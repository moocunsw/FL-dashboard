                  <p>According to Associate Professor Vishaan Chakrabarti, hyperdensity is good urban design.</p>
                  
                  <p>Vishaan Chakrabarti is Founder of the Partnership for Architecture and Urbanism (PAU), a New York architecture and planning practice dedicated to the advancement of cities, and was previously a partner at SHoP Architects. He is also an Associate Professor of Practice at Columbia University. Chakrabarti argues that hyperdensity, defined as density sufficient to support intensive public transportation systems - typically regarded as 30 dwelling units per acre or 75 units per hectare, contributes to health, prosperity and sustainability of cities.</p>

                  Hyperdensity: 30 dwelling units per acre / 75 units per hectare</p>
                  
                  <p>Density is a measure of the number of dwellings or population size in a given land area. It is often discussed and visualised in terms of the building height/number of storeys in relation to the amount of open space, as shown in the <a href=""https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/files/8e/ed/8eedfd67-9166-48a2-809c-c97afcdf4685/visualisingdensity.pdf"">visualising density infographic</a>. This can also be seen in seen in the <a href=""http://www.ecodencity.com.au/density-simulator/"">Urban Taskforce Australia&#8217; Density Simulator</a>.</p>
                  
                  <p>Chakrabarti has written a book called &#8216;Country of Cities: A Manifesto for an Urban America&#8217; and an article titled <a href=""https://placesjournal.org/article/building-hyperdensity-and-civic-delight/"">Building Hyperdensity and Civic Delight</a>. He also gave a public lecture at UNSW Australia on this topic, which we have formatted into 3 episodes, as videos on YouTube. These are provided as additional resources to further explain the importance of density and how it can be positive for cities in terms of beauty, joy, public health, economy and the environment.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>1. <a href=""https://youtu.be/BpuRJwkwsO4"">Introduction</a> (6:17)</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>Vishaan Chakrabarti introduces the concept of hyperdensity, linking density to sustainability, and discussing why cities are better in reducing the carbon footprint per capita.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>2. <a href=""https://youtu.be/kXukRMSO26M"">Hyperdensity in context</a> (12:47)</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>With the premise that cities are fundamentally better based on the metrics of the environment, economy, public health and joy, Vishaan Chakrabarti discusses how to build better cities.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>3. <a href=""https://youtu.be/MA4H2lS67pE"">Hyperdensity design by SHoP Architects</a> (6:15)</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>Vishaan Chakrabarti discusses hyperdense architecture by SHoP Architects, including the Barclay&#8217;s Arena, Gotham Gateway, Essex Crossing Masterplan, and Domino Sugar Refinery Masterplan.</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Discussion Activity</strong></p>
                  
                    <p>The hyperdensity model proposed by Chakrabati suggests &#8216;leaving nature natural&#8217;, with cities having concentrated infrastructure and shared resources.

                  <p>Settlements are usually designated as urban once they have grown large enough to support industries which are not rural in nature. No common figure can be put on the size of an urban area as settlements function differently in different areas due to local circumstances.</p>
                  
                  <p>However, in Australia, census districts which have a population density of 200 or more persons per square kilometre are classified as urban.</p>

The creation of a 3D printed product is achieved using additive processes whereby an object is created by laying down successive layers of material. An advantage of the process is that complex three-dimensional forms can be created to rapid prototype a design.</p>

                  <p>We have had an amazing first week, with over 5,000 people signing up to take the course; and we are very grateful for the extremely positive response to the course so far. We are delighted to see how many people across the world have taken the opportunity to engage with the discussion forums. If you have not already done so, introduce yourself to your fellow learners and join our <a href=""https://www.zeemaps.com/map?group=1929543"">interactive map</a> to locate the city in which you are based.</p>
                  
                  <p>We are blown away by the richness in the discussions and the diversity of your experiences. It is also great to see you engaging with each others&#8217; comments. Please keep this up! Thank you for your enthusiastic comments and contributions to the various discussions, and also to the <a href=""http://padlet.com/UNSW/p1p5e8cxqkka"">Padlet page</a>.

                  <p>The Poll exercise that required you to select your 3 main elements of enchantment for cities has proven a bit challenging and some participants also said that it was difficult to limit this choice to only 3. We agree that 3 elements would not be enough to fully capture enchantment in cities.

                  <p><strong>Does enchantment fade over time?</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>While examples like the dancing traffic light are fun and engaging the first time people see and interact with it, its captivation and magic may not be as significant after seeing it over an extended period. How do we maintain enchantment over an extended period? Ideas shared included:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>When a story becomes embedded into the experience</li>
                    <li>When public places become platforms for inhabitants to share ideas</li>
                    <li>When an object/the environment responds in an &#8216;intelligent&#8217; way to users</li>
                    <li>Is moving on an emotional level</li>
                    <li>Art integrated with participation</li>

                  <p>Jane Jacobs spoke of the &#8216;sidewalk ballet&#8217;, which is the dynamic unfolding of the city&#8217;s life, a form of art represented by interactions of neighbours, passers-by, children playing, shopkeepers.</p>
                  
                  <p><em>&#8220;we may fancifully call it the art form of the city and liken it to the dance &#8212; not to a simple-minded precision dance with everyone kicking up at the same time, twirling in unison and bowing off en masse, but to an intricate ballet in which the individual dancers and ensembles all have distinctive parts which miraculously reinforce each other and compose an orderly whole.&#8221;</em> (Jane Jacobs, 1961, The Death and Life of Great American Cities)</p>
                  
                  <p>See this sidewalk ballet in <a href=""https://www.google.com/doodles/jane-jacobs-100th-birthday"">Google&#8217;s Doodle</a> to celebrate what would have been Jacob&#8217;s 100th birthday (May 4, 2016).</p>
                  
                  <p>For many in this course, the &#8216;whimsical unfolding of civic life&#8217; or &#8216;living culture of a city&#8217; remains a key part of what they find enchanting. Examples included from Sydney, Cape Town, Florida.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Hyperdensity and its applicability to your environment</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>Not surprising, there were mixed views on hyperdensity. People see the benefits of shared resources and energy savings as a result. In addition, lower travel time to/from work, walkability to amenities is high. Perceived dislikes / concerns / issues were raised, including:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>affordability and cost of services</li>
                    <li>backyards and their value to families</li>
                    <li>busyness/crowding nature of high density, lack of areas for solitude</li>
                    <li>crime</li>
                    <li>economic constraints of some cities/countries</li>
                    <li>geographic issues</li>
                    <li>integration of old people into the community</li>
                    <li>noise</li>
                    <li>privacy</li>
                    <li>size of apartments - liveability on inside</li>
                    <li>social problems of isolation</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>Questions raised include how hyperdensity could be applied to specific contexts, like developing countries, whether it always is accompanied by suitable planning and infrastructure. Next week, we will engage with city planning and we hope the discussions can continue in that context.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>What&#8217;s Next?</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>In <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/re-enchanting-the-city/1/todo/4083"">Week 2</a>, Fight for the Site, we look at the story of Central Park, the development processes behind the making of it, and the significance of this $2Billion development within the urban fabric of Sydney. It skims over the site&#8217;s early history to consider in more detail the narrative of site-planning politics from 2003, when the land first came up for sale, to 2007, when the first concept plan was approved. This will include purchases, sackings, market collapses, changes of government, local controversy, design competitions, committees, master plans and litigation.</p>

                  <p>Summary thoughts</p>
                  
                  <p>Thanks for all the contributions through this week, valuable links provided and debate over important issues relating to Central Park and other developments around the world.</p>
                  
                  <p>The main activities involved discussion of contentious developments in your location, who you identify with and a poll over who &#8216;owns&#8217; the city. There were no shortage of controversial developments to share by various participants. Many participants aligned to architects, urban designers and planners, since they are working in these fields. The community voice received strong endorsement, reinforced in discussion with Jeanette Brokman&#8217;s video. The role of the activist camp also received a high level of support.</p>
                  
                  <p>The <a href=""https://futurelearn.typeform.com/report/GF35BI/KUBW"">poll results are in</a> and participants view Government as having most influence over the city.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Key themes emerging from the week</strong></p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>The role of women in the built environment, including the need to increase their presence and representation;</li>
                    <li>The nature of healthy cities;</li>
                    <li>The challenge between planners and planning authorities;</li>
                    <li>Affordability of housing with increasing density.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p><strong>Professor Susan Thompson&#8217;s reflections</strong></p>
                  
                  <p><em>Inclusion of women</em><br/>
                  Quote from Dorothy: &#8220;As for the competition I was surprised, astonished actually, that an all male jury was chosen. Women relate and access space and place in different ways to men and their perspective should have been considered.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p>This is an incredibly important point raised.  For a long time, we did not recognise population diversity in planning and designing for spaces and places.  We assumed a model of society as the nuclear family with a male breadwinner and stay-at-home woman care-giver and mother.  There was no appreciation of diversity around gender, sexuality, age, ability (physical and mental), culture, ethnicity nor religious affiliation.  Socio-economic status was also largely ignored.  Things are different now with a much greater attention to diversity, with the aim of making our cities appropriate for all.  But of course, there is lots of room for improvement still!</p>
                  
                  <p>You can explore some of these issues in the following texts:</p>

                    <li>John Short: The Humane City (1989, Blackwell) &#8211; this is especially useful in understanding how we use to plan without consideration for diversity &#8211; including gender!</li>

                  <p><em>Healthy cities</em><br/>
                  A health city is a green city!  It is also a safe city &#8211; people have to perceive the environment to be safe, otherwise, they will not venture out.  Here are some great resources that on this:
                  <a href=""http://www.hphpcentral.com/"">http://www.hphpcentral.com/</a>: This web site contains a wealth of resources about the health benefits of nature.</p>
                  
                  <p>Of particular interest is this article about green space in cities for both human health and environmental health: <a href=""http://www.hphpcentral.com/article/urban-planning-and-the-importance-of-green-space-in-cities-to-human-and-environmental-health"">http://www.hphpcentral.com/article/urban-planning-and-the-importance-of-green-space-in-cities-to-human-and-environmental-health</a></p>
                  
                  <p>A recent study of community gardens and their importance was undertaken by the NSW Environment Trust.  You can download it from here:  <a href=""http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/grants/150803-Community-Food-Initiatives.pdf%20"">http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/grants/150803-Community-Food-Initiatives.pdf </a></p>

                  <p>And there is work that we did at UNSW a while back on community gardens in low income housing estates with a very culturally diverse community: <a href=""https://socialsciences.arts.unsw.edu.au/media/SOSSFile/A_Bountiful_Harvest.pdf"">https://socialsciences.arts.unsw.edu.au/media/SOSSFile/A_Bountiful_Harvest.pdf</a></p>
                  
                  <p><em>Planning challenges</em><br/>
                  Community consultation is a very important issue and given the political nature of planning, genuine community consultation is not always occurring. <br/>

                  <p><em>Affordability</em><br/>
                  The issue of housing affordability is currently dominating the discourse on housing.  The <a href=""https://cityfutures.be.unsw.edu.au/"">City Futures Research Centre</a> at UNSW has done a lot of research in this area. Have a look at the Centre&#8217;s blog for articles on housing affordability (and lots more!): <a href=""http://blogs.unsw.edu.au/cityfutures/blog/category/affordable-housing/"">http://blogs.unsw.edu.au/cityfutures/blog/category/affordable-housing/</a></p>

                  <p><strong>Masterplan clarification</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>There was a misunderstanding by some about the masterplan Emeritus Professor Alec Tzannes and Professor James Weirick spoke about and what we have now. The video covered design thinking about the Cox-Tzannes proposal, which is not the masterplan we have for Central Park today.</p>
                  
                  <p>In 2004, a masterplan competition was held for the site with the Cox-Tzannes proposal ranked first.<br/>
                  In 2007, Frasers Centerpoint Limited purchased the site and hired Foster + Partners to revise the Cox-Tzannes masterplan.<br/>
                  In 2009, the Foster + Partners masterplan was approved by the NSW Department of Planning.<br/>

It covers urban design and iconic design, as well as celebrity architects (Starchitects) and their role in sites like Central Park. The site embodies an unusually high concentration of international design talent. Questions explored are: &#8220;What is urban design&#8221;?, &#8220;What is its role in city-making, and in the re-enchantment agenda&#8221;? and &#8220;What are the dynamics startchitects bring to an urban development?&#8221;.</p>

                  <p>In Week 3, we looked at urban design and architecture, exploring design diversity in city making; the ways architects engage with the development process and the starchitect phenomenon. Key themes/ideas emerging from this week include:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>A green grid as an additional layer to urban design representing the ecology of the city</li>
                    <li>Modern vs post-modernist approaches to ornament for buildings</li>
                    <li>The relationship between residents and green space, including the balcony plantings.</li>
                    <li>Sensitivity and respect to heritage &#8211; what represents successful integration of old and new</li>
                    <li>The value and drawbacks of starchitects</li>

                  <p>There were questions on the work of urban designers and who employs them.</p>
                  
                  <p>In Australia, urban designers qualified through a Master Degree are eligible to apply for membership of the Urban Design Chapter of the Planning Institute of Australia.</p>
                  
                  <p>The Planning Institute describes urban design as &#8220;the creation of useful, attractive, safe, environmentally sustainable, economically successful and socially equitable place&#8221; that draws on local identity, culture, and environment. See: <a href=""http://www.planning.org.au/aboutpia/urban-design"">http://www.planning.org.au/aboutpia/urban-design</a></p>
                  
                  <p>Also see also Urban Design Policy from the Australian Institute of Architects: <a href=""http://architecture.com.au/docs/default-source/act-notable-buildings/urban-design-policy.pdf"">http://architecture.com.au/docs/default-source/act-notable-buildings/urban-design-policy.pdf</a></p>
                  
                  <p>A career as an urban designer could be in a private office and/or a government office. Urban Designers can work in urban design consultancies, private professional practice such as architectural/planning/landscape architecture firms, and city agencies.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id=""urban-design-and-education"">Urban Design and Education</h4>
                  
                  <p>Arguably, the introduction of the study of Urban Design, as we define it today, started at Harvard Graduate School of Design (1953) followed by Penn University Philadelphia with the Institute of Urban Studies (1954), MIT with the Center for Urban Studies (1957) and at Columbia University with the Master of Science for Urban Design (1964). Their educational programs started a system of research combined with teaching, which influenced the design and realization of many North and South American cities.</p>
                  
                  <p>Cities like Detroit (Eliel Saarinen), Philadelphia (Louis Kahn, Robert Mitchell, Edmund Bacon) as well as Boston, Lima, Medellin and Bogota&#8217; (Jose&#8217; Lluis Sert) grew up from that integrated model of research and teaching.</p>

                  <p>Heritage and conservation consciousness in Sydney was established in 1971 with the City of Sydney Strategic Plan. Addressing heritage considerations is now an integral component of the development approval process which revolves around a contextual philosophy of &#8216;design excellence&#8217;.</p>
                  
                  <p>For me, in Sydney there are a number of Interesting projects which combine a respectful design approach to heritage buildings and their adaptive reuse where &#8216;old and new&#8217; complement each other.</p>
                  
                  <p>Romaldo Giurgola&#8217;s New Parramatta Cathedral; Tonkin, Zulaika, Greer&#8217;s adaptive reuse of Sydney Old Custom House and Foster + Partners&#8217; addition of the Reichstag in Berlin as the new Parliament are all examples of how architects can achieve a successful integration of old and new.</p>
                  
                  <p>The heritage buildings keep their historical integrity and visibility through a sensitive respect for the existing volumes, the conservation of the original materials and the restoration of the most important original interior spaces. While the visibility of the new volumes and geometries, like in the glazed cupola of Foster + Partners in Berlin, and interior spaces are all created through a sophisticated design using new materials and contemporary technologies with the aim of enhancing the original fabric. The result is a balanced visible composition of old and new volumes, materials and usable spaces.</p>
                  
                  <p>Opened in 2004, The Mint, is Richard Francis-Jones&#8217; (and FJMT) demonstration of how a new project can connect and add a new chapter to the continuity of history. Architecture can transform a heritage place into a contemporary place &#8220;through a respectful attitude to both conservation and renewal&#8221;.

                  <p>The <a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/vgdta63zg6zh"">Week 3 Padlet wall</a> has been populated with international examples of design diversity or the odd starchitect. Many agreed with Alex from Sydney, that Gaudi&#8217;s architecturally designed cathedral in Barcelona, La Sagrada Familia, was a good example of a starchitect. Bo Kapp, Cape Town, as shared by Rikus, formally the Malay Quarter, shows the contrast and diversity between brightly colour residences and mosques in the same area.</p>
                  
                  <p>There were many Australian iconic buildings posted to the <a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/35x1g487dy9g"">Padlet Wall</a>, including Sydney Opera House, Sydney Tower, MLC Centre, Australia Square and Parliament House. One of the most liked international buildings posted was the Burj Al Arab in Dubai. Thanks Joan from Dubai, UAE, for sharing this truly iconic building. Designed by Atkins, led by British architect Tom Wright, this sail-like structure along the shores of Jumeriah Beach, is impressive!</p>

                  The discussion engaged with modern and post-modern philosophies including &#8216;less is more&#8217;, &#8216;form follows function&#8217;, Vitruvius and the cantilever as &#8216;illogical&#8217; composition.</p>

                    <li>
                      <p>Maggy from Lancashire, England, pointed out that in One Central Park, it &#8220;looks like the planters are outside the glass enclosures of the balconies&#8221; and questioned what this means for maintenance. Bart reinforced the concern of &#8220;one cannot take care of the plants that can be almost touched.&#8221;</p>

                    <li>
                      <p>Many agreed that the Foster + Partners&#8217; building dominates the heritage Australian hotel building. Samuel from Sydney expressed it looks like a &#8220;like a rotten toe nail to a tower&#8221;.</p>

                    <li>
                      <p>Hugo from Sydney was well supported in his view that the &#8220;Tri-generation plants in Central Park are and will be excellent testament to the successful possibilities of adaptive reuse&#8221;. He also raised a question for adaptive reuse &#8220;at what point does it denigrate into facade-ism&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

                    <li>
                      <p>Abdurrazaaq from Cape Town pointed out that &#8220;Many professionals in the architectural field are anti starchitects&#8221;, and mentioned the problem of the &#8220;Bilbao effect&#8221;: <a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21591708-if-you-build-it-will-they-come-bilbao-effect"">http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21591708-if-you-build-it-will-they-come-bilbao-effect</a></p>

                  <h3 id=""whats-next"">What&#8217;s Next?</h3>
                  
                  <p>In Week 4, Being Green, we focus on this 5 Green-star development&#8217;s most significant sustainability initiatives, on sustainable urbanism and the inclusion of nature into the city. It examines design innovations in green technologies, and environmental building services. The examples discussed are the living green walls (inspiring/green seduction); the trigeneration system (energy use); and water recycling (rainwater collection and reuse of waste). Some of the questions considered are:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>What are the main considerations and strategies for sustainability?</li>
                    <li>How does landscape architecture contribute to living green?</li>
                    <li>Why it is important to renature the city?</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>We hope discussions of the themes raised this week will expand and develop further in week 4.</p>

                  <h3 id=""reflection-from-associate-professor-linda-corkery"">Reflection from Associate Professor Linda Corkery</h3>
                  
                  <p>It has been terrific to see the level of engagement with the ideas and information presented during Week 4, &#8220;Being Green&#8221;. Thank you all for your comments. You&#8217;ve reflected thoughtfully, made relevant points, and raised provocative ideas.</p>
                  
                  <p>By this time in the course, it should be clear that many different approaches will be required to implement &#8220;green&#8221; planning, designing, and building for cities of the future.  In anticipation of more people and changing climates, all built environment professionals -landscape architects, architects, planners, urban designers, builders and developers - must work together to find innovative solutions that will meet these challenges. No doubt, you&#8217;re beginning to understand: the issues are complex. No one profession has the full scope of understanding or all the knowledge and expertise needed to address them.</p>
                  
                  <p>This week we&#8217;ve looked at how the Central Park development explicitly demonstrates &#8216;green&#8217; approaches to urban development - for example, with Patrick Blanc&#8217;s green walls, planting boxes across the building facades, the Chippendale Green open space; and how it implicitly incorporates &#8216;green&#8217; technologies, such as the trigeneration system, water recycling, contemporary glazing and window shading systems - technologies that may not be seen or readily recognised.  There are multiple ways to be &#8216;green&#8217; when we&#8217;re designing and constructing new urban precincts. Central Park will be a good site to keep studying to determine if it is a useful prototype for future urban development in Sydney.</p>
                  
                  <p>Although this week&#8217;s presentations have not just been about landscape architecture, I hope you&#8217;ve gained a broader understanding of this profession and, in particular, the role landscape architects play in creating the public domain and strengthening cities&#8217; resilience in the face of climate change. As a profession, we take the view that urban landscapes must be regarded as urban &#8216;green infrastructure&#8217;, essential to a city&#8217;s environmental, social and economic performance and, ultimately, its liveability. Urban landscapes are regenerative. They give back to the urban environment in many ways, such as, improving biodiversity, air and water quality, assisting in storm water management, producing food, and importantly - creating beautiful places which are valued by the people who live and work there.</p>

                  <p>Here are 6 places (and the year they were opened) that for me are especially memorable and that work so well as public outdoor spaces:</p>

                  <h3 id=""question-about-residents-relationship-to-balcony-plantings"">Question about residents&#8217; relationship to balcony plantings</h3>
                  
                  <p>In week 3, it was asked that if people cannot physically access their balcony plantings, does that impact the care and personal connection. This question is difficult to answer and could be part of a research questionnaire or focus group discussion to determine.</p>
                  
                  <p>This week, the sophisticated water irrigation system treating the plants was discussed. The residents are not responsible for the maintenance of the plants but rather a team of experts. To read more on this, have a look at the page: <a href=""http://junglefy.com.au/junglefy/a-day-in-the-life-maintaining-one-central-park/"">A Day in the Life &#8211; Maintaining One Central Park</a></p>
                  
                  <p>Clearly, the look of the green walls and planter boxes are all part of the ongoing identity of this project and so Junglefly&#8217;s daily and weekly maintenance ensures it is healthy and attractive all the time. For the residents, the view out of their apartments, with this planting in the foreground, is part of the appeal of living in this building and a reminder that they live in a &#8216;green&#8217; building.</p>

                  <p>The most liked Padlet post as of 28/5 is the <a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/kl0xfday2192/wish/112060920"">Paddington Water Reservoir Gardens</a>, shared by Furio from Sydney.</p>
                  
                  <p>Other popular examples of inspiring landscape designs included a <a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/kl0xfday2192/wish/112281796"">vertical garden coffee shop in Adelaide</a> (Mary-Anne from Melbourne), <a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/kl0xfday2192/wish/112107030"">Parc Guell, Barcelona</a> (Hugo from Sydney), <a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/kl0xfday2192/wish/112305347"">Oranjezicht City Farm, Cape Town</a> (Belinda from Cape Town)</p>
                  
                  <p>The examples shared and discussed contributed to living green through providing enchanting, restful environments, simplicity vs. complexity, shade and shelter, producing food, and contributing to biodiversity.</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>Laurence and Silvia from Tuscon, Arizona, continued a poetic engagement with the course topics with poetry that included &#8216;Green as the Color of What&#8217; and &#8216;The Case for a Garden in the Park&#8217;. Associate Professor Linda Corkery responded that the &#8220;creative response captures many of the conundrums associated with our attempts to be more &#8216;green&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Liz from Canada, Flinn from Sydney, and Victoria reminded us of Kermit&#8217;s saying &#8220;it&#8217;s not easy, being green.&#8221; <a href=""https://youtu.be/hpiIWMWWVco"">https://youtu.be/hpiIWMWWVco</a></p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>There was a debate on whether culture or governance should be the fourth pillar in the sustainability bottom lines.</p>
                  
                  <p>The general consensus around the bottom lines appears to be that all must be balanced, but in different cases a particular bottom line might take the lead. Veronica from Uruguay states this eloquently &#8211; &#8220;They are a &#8220;package of issues&#8221; and we cannot ignore this when we are talking about city development. Almost everyone is looking how to mix and balance this complicated package to get the best outcome.&#8221;</p>

                    <li>
                      <p>Melisa stated: &#8220;good governance is the key to delivering the other three aspects.&#8221;</p>

                    <li>

                    <li>
                      <p>Muaz from Qatar provided input from another MOOC and problems about cultural diversity as a barrier. He noted the issues around cultural differences and implementation of sustainability and argues sustainability needs its own global culture.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Marry-Ann also provided input from another FutureLearn course on intercultural communication and stated: &#8220;I like the &#8220;both and&#8221; not &#8220;either or&#8221; approach to culture.&#8221;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Many were won over by the exuberance of Patrick Blanc. Helen from Victoria, Australia, stated: &#8220;artist to artist I get it&#8230;.environmentally and maintenance-wise I&#8217;m not so sure&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Many debated whether trigeneration was the right choice since it is a fossil fuel, and even though trigeneration may a transition, temporary approach, Jason from Sydney noted &#8220;the tendency to become permanent was my concern.&#8221;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Abigail from Oklahoma shared thoughts on the &#8220;Aeroponic Garden at Chicago&#8217;s O&#8217;Hare Airport as an excellent idea for providing not only fresh food from sustainable sources, but also as a green connection for those who use the building.&#8221; <a href=""http://www.flychicago.com/OHare/EN/AboutUs/Sustainability/Aeroponic-Garden.aspx"">http://www.flychicago.com/OHare/EN/AboutUs/Sustainability/Aeroponic-Garden.aspx</a></p>

                  <p>In <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/re-enchanting-the-city/1/todo/4086"">Week 5</a>, Technopolis, it is all about technology. We examine design innovations in day-lighting, structure, construction, and building services.  It is about how technology can harness nature to serve people; how it can help in making a place liveable, enchanting and poetic. It is also about the people who &#8220;make this happen&#8221;. Central Park&#8217;s stand-out features are the amazing 45m, 110 tons cantilevered heliostat tracking the sun and the 1110m2 of vertical gardens growing plants 100m in the air, called &#8220;living architecture&#8221;. Both are discussed in this module as to why they are important and the role they may play in re-enchantment. To this end, industrial designers collaborated with engineers, horticulturalists, and botanists to make it happen.</p>

                  Video showing the construction of the Central Park cantilever and heliostat. In the early hours of Friday 1 February, a 110 tonne steel frame was lifted 100 metres into the sky, high above Sydney&#8217;s Broadway in Chippendale, and fixed to the side of a dramatic residential tower, forever changing the profile of Broadway. The lift marks the most complex part of the construction of Australia&#8217;s first residential heliostat, dramatically cantilevered from the Jean Nouvel-designed &#8216;One Central Park&#8217; on Broadway.</p>

                  Architects in Sydney, Australia have found a way to light up a part of the city that was once perpetually dark, hidden from the sun by tall buildings. They&#8217;ve done it by capturing the sunshine, and bouncing it between buildings with an architectural device called a heliostat. Lester Ranby reports.</p>

                  <h3 id=""reflection-from-dr-miles-park"">Reflection from Dr Miles Park</h3>
                  
                  <p>Thank you all for your contributions this past week. We have all learnt from each other and discussed many interesting topics concerning the theme of Technology. As we have discovered technology embraces a broad sweep of topics and concerns.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id=""the-good-and-bad-of-technology"">The good and bad of technology</h4>
                  
                  <p>Many of us love our technologies &#8211; particularly internet connected devices. The Heliostat is clearly an overt expression of technology at Central Park, but many other applications of technology at the site are equally vital but less apparent and may not be immediately obvious to the casual observer. Many of you identified hidden technologies such as plumbing and electricity, as equally important. Hugo and others suggest we need a broader perspective about our unquestioning acceptance of technology. Laurence and Silvia offered us a poem or two. (I wasn&#8217;t game enough to respond in prose.) They are equally concerned about technology, and closes their poem post with, &#8220;We need first to think of humanity And make technology a tool again&#8221;, which reminds me of the popular quote, &#8220;We shape our tools and thereafter they shape us&#8221;.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id=""we-asked-you-to-identify-a-vital-technology-in-your-environment-and-what-ways-it-enhances-your-life"">We asked you to identify a vital technology in your environment and what ways it enhances your life?</h4>
                  
                  <p>Again, a number of you remarked about technologies that are hidden or invisible to our everyday experiences. Electricity, penicillin and plumbing come to mind. For many of us, it&#8217;s hard to imagine life without these necessities, despite for many who still go without. Another often mentioned technology is the Internet, without which we would not be having this conversation!</p>
                  
                  <h4 id=""we-asked-you-to-post-an-indispensable-product-or-object"">We asked you to post an Indispensable product or object</h4>
                  
                  <p>Many of you posted ipads/tablets, smart devices and laptops which reminds us how dependent we are on the internet. I wonder if we asked the same question in 10 years&#8217; time if we would see similar but more advanced technologies? Or for that matter, if we had asked this question 10 years ago. I suspect we may have seen a few iPods, now an obsolescent (see below) technology.  Your product choices ranged in scale from the Panama Canal to a set of keys, and from the life-saving (EpiPen) to the less life-saving (Beer bottle &#8216;stubby&#8217; holder).</p>
                  
                  <h4 id=""technical-obsolescence"">Technical obsolescence</h4>
                  
                  <p>Technology can also have unpredictable and unintended consequences. One such consequence is obsolescence. In terms of our case study - Central Park &#8211;  the overall site (landscape), buildings, and significant technological elements (Heliostat, Trigen and green walls) will all experience differing lifespans. The technological elements will no doubt have the shortest lifespan. For example, Heliostats rated for a service life of 25 years.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id=""heliostat-technology"">Heliostat technology</h4>
                  <p>Many of you are intrigued about the heliostat and posed some interesting questions.  I emailed these to Tim Philips at Tilt Industrial Design (formally Kennovations) who lead the industrial design on the project.  Below is a response to your questions:</p>
                  
                  <p><em>Has there been either wind conditions or component failures so far that have led the system to go to its &#8216;safe&#8217; configuration and leave the usually illuminated areas in shadow?</em></p>
                  
                  <p>Yes &#8211; there have been many occasions where the system has been affected by wind sufficiently to proceed to stow or &#8216;safe&#8217;. Interestingly, the high wind occasions occur most often when the weather is poor and therefore not sunny, so the impact is minimal. High wind and rain often occur together, not high wind and sun &#8211; so the impact on the system is minimal as a percentage of effective time.</p>
                  
                  <p><em>How realistic is the design life of 25 years?  How was that determined</em></p>
                  
                  <p>With regular maintenance, the system should work effectively for this time-frame and beyond. The maintenance contract in place dictates not just maintenance of material and parts, but upgrades to control software and systems. So the technology should evolve over time and not become outdated. The buildings the system is integrated into is designed for 25yrs &#8211; and so this was the benchmark we pursued.</p>
                  
                  <p><em>What is the film material you use on the mirrors? Can it be utilised in light wells?</em></p>
                  
                  <p>We use anodised aluminum composite panel. There are several products of this type available that have been specifically developed for the concentrated solar thermal market where they are utilised in the production of &#8216;trough&#8217; mirrors. The material is lightweight, can be curved if necessary (as for troughs) and is highly resistant to damage (hail). It comes with warranties comparable to glass mirror.</p>
                  
                  <p><em>I was curious too about the costs. I&#8217;ve only found that the whole site cost $2 billion and that the &#8220;sustainable technologies&#8221; (tri-generation and the living walls?) cost $100 million, or 5% of the total. Did anyone try to value/ justify the light given to the atrium and the park? Much appreciated no doubt, and impossible to value, but still a cost to be paid for.</em></p>
                  
                  <p>For our component the contract was in the order of $2.5M &gt; $3M &#8211; however this does not account for the steel structure of the cantilever and many of the engineering and building integration costs associated with implementing the system. Frasers were able to utilise a portion of their significant public art contribution to offset the cost. The value of the heliostat was in this instance the developers and council agreeing to tower height in certain locations on the site as a result of satisfactory solar access. This has very important future implications for developers whose tower height can be increased resulting in calculable returns on investment. One project we are working on is likely to increase its tower height from 17 storeys to 36 by addressing overshadowing i.e. eliminating the shadow that the building would create using heliostats.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""summary-thoughts-from-associate-professor-oya-demirbilek"">Summary thoughts from Associate Professor Oya Demirbilek</h3>
                  
                  <p>We discussed how important industrial design is in our daily lives and that it is was a much broader field of work than some of you anticipated. As Richard (from Sydney) said, &#8220;good design, occurs when the user is at the centre of the process&#8221;, putting a lot of thinking and detail into everyday objects and environments. We also talked about the eventual dematerialisation of some product categories, together with the ever-increasing importance of good design. We touched on the creative thinking process and the importance of doing thorough research with people. Industrial designers are very good at keeping the big picture in mind, while zooming in and out, switching from a convergent mode of thinking (focused and detail oriented, looking for the right solution) to a divergent mode (expansive, looking at opportunities and options). They are also very good at collaborating with all other disciplines.</p>
                  
                  <p>Good design and respect for nature emerged in the discussions as important aspects in creating vibrant communities. Technology was discussed by many of you as something to be harnessed to make life easier, but also as a thing upon which most of us are too reliant. We also delved into quality of life discussions, and how technology and design could improve it by providing intuitive and accessible design solutions, and in this way improving our daily life experiences.</p>
                  
                  <p>Here are some good links for design research methods:</p>

The laptop is one of the only products that comes up a few times, followed by smart phones. The activity of identifying vital technology in your environment has also attracted a lot of comments, with electricity, light bulbs and all the services facilitating modern life (power, data, phone, water, sewer, waste management and recycling) being top 3.</p>

                  &#8220;We can often get more result in the same way by beginning several problems in succession, and voluntarily leaving them unfinished while we turn to others, than by finishing our work on each problem at one sitting.&#8221;<br/><a href=""https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/08/28/the-art-of-thought-graham-wallas-stages/"">https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/08/28/the-art-of-thought-graham-wallas-stages/</a></p>

                  <p>In Week 6, Inside Out, we zoom to the human scale and talk to the concepts of the interior room vs urban room (exterior). Exteriors are what is marketed and is purchased, sold and photographed, but interiors are where people dwell.  This week looks at the role of interiority in an urban development, and in a city. It looks at the relationships between the outside and the inside. Early drawings of this development relied heavily on the sense of living inside green walls, almost like living in a forest or treehouse. This week will look at interior design, within the apartments and shopping centre, through the frame of this inside-out relationship. How the light and greenery is brought inside; how private space relates/contributes to public space, and vice versa; how inside and outside interact.</p>

                  <p>This week has explored key design considerations for interior architecture that have included - scale, materials, circulation, inside out relationships, and inspiration from nature.</p>
                  
                  <p>Drawing on what you have learned, select a building with which you feel a close connection, and share the experience of moving across the inside-out threshold. Do you sense a change of scale? Do the materials and lighting influence the experience? What emotions does the circulation pattern evoke?</p>
                  
                  <p>Here we have the Macquarie Bank building in Martin Place, Sydney, which was built in 1928 as the State Savings Bank, and recently renovated. As you walk though the main doors, there is a sense of grandeur and wealth, into the teller space of the old bank.</p>

                  <p>The role of a designer; be it Industrial, Furniture, Landscape , Architect or Interior Architect  is to operate as an independent professional making design judgements that align from within the individuals own value set. These judgements are then applied accordingly around life, societies, cites and ultimately human interactions within the wider environments we inhabit.</p>
                  
                  <p>Our personal values that shape the decisions we make as Interior Architects are formed from many complexities and contexts, so that no one decision is likely to have a cognitive universality that aligns with each and every other individual set of values.</p>
                  
                  <p><em>But isn&#8217;t that what a city is all about?</em></p>
                  
                  <p>A rich inclusive and diverse landscape of people and their different values all working together though the patterns that through our engagement as part of a society we develop.</p>
                  
                  <p>Interior Architecture and Interior Architects are not a &#8216;<em>one fit for all situations</em>&#8217; profession. The designing rules we utilise are plastic - as they should be, bending and addressing the distinctive needs of the City in an agile and thoughtful manner.</p>

                  <p>There was much discussion over the desirability of dark corridors and light apartment interiors, and how well the pictures show the space.</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>Sara from Yarraville suggested &#8220;colours affect the mind and body and black is often associated with aggressiveness, power, authority, style, knowledge and intelligence.&#8221;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Kathryn from Colchester, UK, was surprised that many felt strongly about the colours, reflecting &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s because interiors are so much more &#8216;personal&#8217; than the outside appearance of a building.&#8221;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Abiola liked Chantelle&#8217;s Kramer&#8217;s comment, &#8220;I think circulation should be about arousing curiosity but eliminating confusion&#8221;, as did others who liked Abiola&#8217;s post.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Dorothy from Shropshire noted that the interior architecture &#8220;seems more a reflection of the designers&#8217; personalities rather than that of the people who are going to live there. It&#8217;s a bit like telling people how to think&#8221;, though people will put their own stamp on it, as noted in later comments.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Lubna from Karachi, an interior architect, shared her experience of what&#8217;s involved in the profession, where the &#8220;interior architect&#8217;s job to listen to the wants and needs of the client and make building suggestions&#8221;, taking into account interior construction, lighting and furnishings.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Ettore from Manchester noted that &#8220;the character of the place changes to reflect who inhabits it. You can&#8217;t do that in a hotel.&#8221;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Beverley from Scone, NSW, was reminded of views of Professor L.P Kollar (past academic of UNSW) who felt inside and outside should not be overly blended. She suggested high density medium rise, as in old European and Asian cities, might &#8220;extend flexibly and economically to welcome both richer and poorer among us?&#8221;</p>

                  <p>This Frank Lloyd Wright house was also identified in the inspiring thresholds activity, posted by Debbie from the UK.</p>
                  
                  <p>The top liked inspiring thresholds <a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/j3805aips19d/wish/111960444"">Queen Victoria Building (QVB)</a> posted by Tom from Sydney, with an eloquent description &#8220;Stepping into the QVB from the hustle and bustle transports you back in time a few decades. The materials, ceiling height, details in tiling and cornices all serve to transition the customer.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p>Another well liked threshold post was by Rose of Yass, Australia &#8211; identifying <a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/j3805aips19d/wish/113291378"">Grand Central Terminal, New York City</a> &#8211; &#8220;When you cross the threshold of the building, you are met with a luxurious interior - with elegant marble and an intricate ceiling, the interior makes the user feel connected both to the building and the other individuals using it.&#8220;</p>
                  
                  <h4 id=""green-liveable-and-poetic-ideas"">Green, Liveable and Poetic Ideas</h4>
                  
                  <p>There were many ideas on how to make hyperdense cities green, liveable and poetic, and the roles people play in creating these cities. Some ideas and thoughts include:</p>
                  
                  <ul>

                    <li>sustainability - energy production, reducing and managing waste, reducing exhaust emissions through greater use of public transport (Stuart - Sydney), planning when it comes to green energies (Trinidad - Granada), appropriate sustainable planning (Anges &#8211; Hamilton, NZ)</li>
                    <li>new developments harness to employ eco-friendly techniques such as solar panels, rain water tanks (Alex &#8211; Sydney)</li>
                    <li>sensible green policy creation (Tom &#8211; Sydney)</li>
                    <li>good governance (Lourdes - Barcelona)</li>
                    <li>ensuring outer urban fringe has appropriate infrastructure and good planning (Ben - Sydney)</li>
                    <li>decentralisation with suburbs that are their own little &#8216;suburb-city&#8217; (Romina - Hobart)</li>
                    <li>collaboration and &#8220;blurring the compartmentalisation of roles&#8221; (Hugo - Sydney)</li>
