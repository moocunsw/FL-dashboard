                  <p>Let&#8217;s get started! In this course we&#8217;ll be asking you to take an active role in your own learning &#8212; to investigate some issues that concern you, to go out into the world and make observations about these issues, to discuss your observations with others in the course, and to start testing out some creative interventions. So we start the course with a very practical activity.</p>
                  
                  <h2 id=""a-planet-in-crisis"">A planet in crisis?</h2>
                  <p>Yes, there are a lot of bad things happening out there; we read about them every day. As you&#8217;ll come to see in this course, environmental issues sit at the nexus of science, culture, society and human value systems. Issues like climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution have a wide range of causes and effects and generate diverse opinions and attitudes. So how do we start to identify and untangle these different influences?</p>
                  
                  <p>This activity involves evaluating information about environmental issues as reported in the popular news media. The news articles will help you build familiarity with these issues and also enable us to have discussions about the entanglements between science and humanities, facts and values, in each of these cases.</p>
                  
                  <p>The main thing we hope you take away from this activity is a newfound sensitivity to all the complex interacting factors at play in different environmental situations.</p>

                  <p>In this article, Stephen Muecke, drawing on the work of philosopher Bruno Latour, explains the shift from &#8220;matters of fact&#8221; to &#8220;matters of concern&#8221; as an important step in taking action to counter ecological crises.</p>
                  
                  <p>As a first approximation, we suggested that the Environmental Humanities can do what the sciences can&#8217;t do, what they leave to one side.</p>
                  
                  <p>If we assume that the work of the sciences is to generate reliable data (and that&#8217;s a bit of an assumption), then the work of the Environmental Humanities is to investigate the relation of facts to values. We take the view that no fact is born without a set of values attached, and that the separation of facts from values is an artificial separation.</p>
                  
                  <p>Nature is a work in progress. And so too are living things, like humans, who have evolved on Earth from single-celled organisms to what we are now and to the fantastic creatures we might become in billions of years when the sun, the source of all our energy, finally begins to cool.</p>
                  
                  <p>As we will explore further in Week 2, there was something quite artificial in the way that modern Europeans separated nature off from human society and made it the domain of science. In this domain, objects could be stabilised, as science ruled over the laws of nature.</p>
                  
                  <p>Nature was <em>over there</em> to be exploited. Technology multiplied the effects of energy, in the form of extracted carbon, to build new ways of living on Earth, mainly in vast cities. We thought our distance from nature meant it would not react to our industrial activities &#8212; that exploitation would come for free, so to speak. But now we see nature reacting in all sorts of relatively unpredictable ways.</p>
                  
                  <p>The passage from knowing the facts about nature to efficient extraction of energy comes with greater costs than we thought. One cost is the imperative to change the concepts and the stories we tell as we rebuild our relationship with our planetary home.</p>
                  
                  <p>In the mid-twentieth century, scientists&#8217; excitement over their capacity to split the atom came with an attitude of disinterestedness, even as nuclear bombs destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki: <em>we just deal with the technical side of things &#8212; others can deal with the moral consequences</em>. Since then the story has changed; more people, perhaps most, accept that facts and values are always entangled. If we accept that entanglement, then the new story we tell about nature is not about its pure scientific facts, as if they are &#8220;just there&#8221;, but that facts come into being for reasons like curiosity, need, concern and necessity: human emotions and needs! It is the normal state of affairs for facts and values to be entangled, and we can&#8217;t necessarily prioritise the one over the other.</p>
                  
                  <p>&#8220;Matters of fact&#8221; are also &#8220;matters of concern&#8221; <sup><a href=""#references"">[1]</a></sup>. What one can do is rank matters of concern in order of importance.  Some sort of collective, like a parliament, has the job of doing just that: is it more important to build speed bumps throughout the city (because we are concerned about road safety), or to make the penalties for drink driving harsher? Will a concern for an endangered species override the desire to lease the native forests for logging? The ranking of such problems, which might involve incorporating the &#8220;point of view&#8221; of endangered species in the discussion, is not just a problem for sciences and facts: humanities expertise needs to be on the team as well.</p>

                  <p>To get an appreciation for the complex interconnections between culture, society and environment in a real EH research situation, read the following article by Eben Kirksey:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>Eben Kirksey,  &#8220;<a href=""http://environmentalhumanities.org/arch/vol1/EH1.3.pdf"">Living With Parasites in Palo Verde National Park</a>,&#8221; <em>Environmental Humanities</em> 1 (2012): 23-55.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>Pages 40-44 are particularly illustrative of Eben&#8217;s project.</p>
                  
                  <p>Eben&#8217;s journey to understand the many different stakeholders and forces at play in Palo Verde National Park is a great example of the method Stephen explained in the previous step: &#8220;starting in the middle of actual experiences, observing what is going on then moving outwards to connect it to the kinds of knowledge that will help make sense of the situation.&#8221; The article also illustrates the complex entanglements of culture, society and environment and hits on some key themes that are central to Environmental Humanities, and this course. Many of the terms and ideas from Eben&#8217;s article will resurface in later weeks.</p>
                  
                  <p>In the article, Eben observes that:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>Creatures, like the fringe-toed foam frog, that refuse to participate in anthropocentric collectives are living figures of post-human hopes. Living and dying in zones of abandonment, these organisms are in an epistemological space beyond the reach of scientific measurement and direct biopolitical regulation. Even as aspiring scientists earnestly worked to democratically speak for nature, struggling to build stable speech prosthetics for a multitude of unloved critters, I found constant evidence of constitutive outsiders. I discovered species that were ever elusive, unloved others who were unrepresented in realms of human discourse. (Kirksey 2012, 48)</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>One of the concepts Eben&#8217;s article brings forward is the concept of &#8220;reinstituting the collective&#8221;. When you start observing a particular situation, you might feel a bit lonesome, stuck out on your own (the Master of all that you survey!). But then perhaps you realise that you can&#8217;t make notes without your notebook, or camera, and you need a few concepts to work with, not to mention language&#8230;so you are not just working on your own, you are quite a few. You may also start to change your ideas based on conversations with your peers.</p>
                  
                  <p>Because of a problem in the environment you may make new friends and connections, including with other beings, <em>and things may leap out demanding attention</em>. You can familiarise yourself with them by observing and writing about them. They become part of the collective that needs to be taken into account in the analysis. It&#8217;s like the guy who invented speed humps to slow down cars; in this case, the observation that school children needed greater safety led to children becoming part of the collective, so speed humps were added.</p>

"2.2","Nature as a European invention","Article","","","Week 2","2016-01-18","18 Jan","Week 2: The invention of nature","https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/remaking-nature/1/steps/59855","[<div class=""a-text-context a-text-context--bold-intro"">
                  <p>This week we will continue to lay the foundation for this course by taking a closer look at nature. But we&#8217;re not going to get out our microscopes to do this. Instead, we&#8217;re going to be looking at nature as a <em>conceptual category.</em></p>
                  
                  <p>While it is undeniable &#8212; at least to most of us &#8212; that we inhabit a world full of trees, animals, stones and rivers, how we ought to understand that world is far from clear. In particular, what does it mean to call all this stuff &#8220;nature&#8221;?</p>
                  
                  <p>Nature is a complex term. Raymond Williams famously said that it may be the most complex term in the English language.<sup><a href=""#references"">[1]</a></sup> But there are two main ways in which the term is typically used:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>nature as <em>essence</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>nature as <em>nonhuman</em></p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <h2 id=""nature-as-essence"">Nature as essence</h2>
                  <p>When used in this way, the term &#8220;nature&#8221;&#8217; refers to the fundamental or inner character, or proper functioning, of something. It is in this sense that people might say odd things like &#8220;the nature of a triangle is such that in all possible worlds it will have three sides,&#8221;<sup><a href=""#references"">[2]</a></sup> or debate the &#8220;nature&#8221; of modern architecture. We might also speak about &#8220;human nature&#8221; in this sense &#8212; sometimes saying that it is in our nature to be greedy and self serving, or perhaps invoking the concept in the opposite direction, to say that humans are by our nature caring and considerate.</p>
                  
                  <p>Wherever you stand on the specific issue of the nature of &#8220;human nature&#8221;, the point is that anything and everything might be said to have a &#8220;nature&#8221; in the sense of essence: buildings, triangles, atoms, even people. How to define and describe these various natures &#8212; that is, the essential or proper features of a thing &#8212; will continue to be controversial though.</p>
                  
                  <h2 id=""nature-as-nonhuman"">Nature as nonhuman</h2>
                  <p>The other main way that we tend to use the term nature is to describe the collection of nonhuman entities in the world. In this sense, wilderness is often understood to be the purest form of nature. This is probably the dominant way that the term is used today.&#8221;&#8216;Nature&#8221; is a place <em>out there</em>, beyond the borders of the city, untouched by human hands. From this perspective there may still be little pockets of &#8220;nature&#8221; in the city &#8212; parks or backyards &#8212; but the extent to which we will be prepared to call them nature will depend on how much they have been altered by human presence or impact.</p>
                  
                  <h2 id=""confused-natures"">Confused natures</h2>
                  <p>It is this second meaning of nature that we will be focused on in this course, but the two cannot be neatly separated from each other. For example, if someone says that genetically modified foods are &#8220;unnatural&#8221;, what do they mean? They might mean that genetic technologies have altered the plant&#8217;s essence (understood as its genome), that they have altered its proper character or state. But they might also mean that these technologies are an imposition of human influence, a perversion of a previously, &#8220;natural&#8221; form (a form unaltered by human action).</p>
                  
                  <p>Neither of these are very good arguments against genetically modified organisms, but they do illustrate the difficulty of making a solid distinction between nature as essence and as nonhuman (this is not to say that there aren&#8217;t other, better, arguments against these technologies). This example also highlights the important political and ethical work that this term often does. As Raymond Williams noted:</p>
                  
                  <p>&#8220;In some serious argument, but even more in popular controversy and in various kinds of contemporary rhetoric, we continually come across propositions of the form &#8220;Nature is &#8230; &#8220;, or &#8220;Nature shows &#8230; &#8220;, or &#8220;Nature teaches &#8230; &#8220;. And what is usually apparent about what is then said is that it is selective, according to the speaker&#8217;s general purpose.&#8221;<sup><a href=""#references"">[3]</a></sup></p>
                  
                  <p>To call something &#8220;unnatural&#8221; implies that it is not proper, not how it ought to be. To be called &#8220;natural&#8221; often implies the opposite. We will return to this point in more detail a little later.</p>
                  
                  <h2 id=""dualisms"">Dualisms</h2>
                  <p>The key to understanding how &#8220;nature&#8221; (as nonhuman) functions in the modern world is appreciating that it is a strongly dualistic term. At the simplest level, a <em>dualism</em> is the conceptual division of something into two distinct parts. In Western thought, nature has tended to be understood as dualistically opposed to culture or humanity. Nature is those parts or places that are (relatively) unaffected by people.</p>
                  
                  <p>This way of dividing up the world positions humans as fundamentally outside nature. As William Cronon notes, from this perspective: &#8220;The place where we are is the place where nature is not.&#8221; <sup><a href=""#references"">[4]</a></sup></p>
                  
                  <p>For those of us raised and educated within this kind of framework it seems entirely obvious, natural even. How else could we understand things?</p>
                  
                  <p>It turns out, however, that many other cultures do not, and have not, divided the world up in this way. The nature/culture dualism is the product of the very particular cultural history of the West.<sup><a href=""#references"">[5]</a><a href=""#references"">[6]</a><a href=""#references"">[7]</a></sup> It is not &#8220;true&#8221; in any meaningful sense, it is just one way of understanding things &#8212; and potentially a very problematic one. The environmental philosopher Val Plumwood has called the nature/culture dualism &#8220;the foundational delusion of the West&#8221; and has argued that it is a &#8220;dangerous doctrine, strongly implicated in the environmental crisis.&#8221;<sup><a href=""#references"">[8]</a></sup></p>
                  
                  <h2 id=""how-did-we-get-here"">How did we get here?</h2>
                  <p>If this is the case, if the nature/culture dualism is a product of a peculiarly Western or European cultural history, then how did we happen to get here? How did the West end up with this particular way of dividing up the world?</p>
                  
                  <p>The history of ideas is a complex field. Even once we appreciate that our understanding of &#8220;nature&#8221; is just that, a particular understanding, not reality itself, teasing out how we arrived here is difficult. In all likelihood there is no single, simple, root cause.</p>
                  
                  <p>Plumwood calls this dualism &#8220;the love-child of the old dominant narrative of human mastery and centrality mated with the much younger circumstance of human experience of commodification in the global city.&#8221;<sup><a href=""#references"">[9]</a></sup></p>
                  
                  <p>Her reference to the city points to forms of human life that are increasingly alienated from (many) nonhumans. While we might still interact with urban wildlife and small &#8220;green spaces,&#8221; fewer and fewer of us spend serious time, or earn a living, interacting with those parts of the world we call &#8220;nature.&#8221; From inside the city &#8212; in contrast to life as a gatherer/hunter, on a farm or in a small town &#8212; it becomes much easier to see nature as something that exists &#8220;out there,&#8221; separate from human life. When children don&#8217;t know that milk comes from cows and think that bears make honey, this alienation seems particularly acute.</p>
                  
                  <p>But the first part of Plumwood&#8217;s quote points to a deeper history of dualistic thinking: &#8220;the old dominant narrative of human mastery and centrality.&#8221; What is this?</p>
                  
                  <p>There are probably many aspects to this narrative in the West, many strands that have come together. The philosopher J. Baird Callicott sums up the key ones in the following quote:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>&#8220;The first and most fundamental feature of the modern idea of nature is a sharp dichotomy between man and nature &#8212; a dichotomy that is all the more radical because it is a feature of both wellsprings of the Western intellectual heritage. In the first book of the Bible, alone among all the other creatures, God makes man in His own image, giving him dominion over and charging him to subdue the earth and all its denizens. In ancient Greek philosophy, man is set apart from nature because he alone among the animals is supposed to be rational. In the late medieval and early modern periods, thinkers as different from one another as Thomas Aquinas and Rene Descartes synthesized these two strands of thought, the Judeo-Christian and Greco-Roman. Thus the man/nature dualism in each augmented the other. And Descartes&#8217; contemporary, Francis Bacon, set the modern agenda for the scientific conquest of nature by man. If we can discover the working principles &#8212; the divinely ordained laws &#8212; of nature, he presciently pointed out, we can bend it to our will.&#8221;<sup><a href=""#references"">[10]</a></sup></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>And so this, in a nutshell, is what we tend to mean by the term &#8220;nature,&#8221; and how it is that we have arrived at this understanding. But is this an accurate or helpful way to understand and divide up the world?</p>

"2.4","What are the implications of nature as a human invention?","Article","","","Week 2","2016-01-18","18 Jan","Week 2: The invention of nature","https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/remaking-nature/1/steps/55446","[<div class=""a-text-context a-text-context--bold-intro"">
                  <p>So far we&#8217;ve explored what we mean by nature and how we arrived at this way of thinking, and we&#8217;ve briefly considered some of the reasons why it is simplistic and inaccurate to understand humanity as existing outside, or separate from, a nonhuman nature.</p>
                  
                  <p>In the remainder of this week we will look at some of the implications, or consequences, of this dualistic understanding of the world. By doing so we hope to convince you that in addition to being inaccurate, a dualistic understanding of the world leads to a range of very worrying ethical and political outcomes.</p>
                  
                  <p>However, before we move on to look at four of the key implications of a nature/culture dualism, we need to say a little more about dualisms themselves.</p>
                  
                  <h2 id=""a-foray-into-dualisms"">A foray into dualisms</h2>
                  
                  <p>The work of Australian philosopher Val Plumwood is absolutely central here. Plumwood&#8217;s account is complex and detailed so we won&#8217;t be able to take it up in full. There are a few key points though that are central.</p>
                  
                  <p>Firstly, Plumwood pointed out that it is not just nature and culture that are understood dualistically in western culture. Instead, she argued that a set of &#8220;interrelated and mutually reinforcing dualisms &#8230; forms a fault-line which runs through its [western culture&#8217;s] entire conceptual system.&#8221; <sup><a href=""#references"">[1]</a></sup></p>
                  
                  <p>Some of the key dualisms that she identified are:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <ul>
                      <li>culture / nature</li>
                      <li>reason / nature</li>
                      <li>male / female</li>
                      <li>mind / body</li>
                      <li>master / slave</li>
                      <li>reason / matter</li>
                      <li>human / nature</li>
                      <li>civilised / primitive</li>
                      <li>human / animal</li>
                    </ul>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>These dualistic categories are not just listed here in any old way. All of those listed on the left have historically been understood to exist in a dominant or superior position to those on the right.</p>
                  
                  <p>Plumwood argued that &#8220;linking postulates&#8221; play a vital role here: &#8220;Linking postulates are assumptions normally made or implicit in the cultural background which create equivalences or mapping between the pairs&#8221; <sup><a href=""#references"">[2]</a></sup>. In this way, humans are more readily associated with culture; males are more readily associated with rationality; the master is seen as being more civilised than the slave.</p>
                  
                  <p>Plumwood offers the following short passage from Aristotle&#8217;s <em>Politics</em> as a key example of an influential philosopher who used supposed shared qualities or characteristics between those things on the left of this list, and between those on the right, to subtly create connections between them in a way that &#8220;justifies&#8221; various forms of domination.</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>&#8220;It is clear that the rule of the soul over the body, and of the mind and the rational element over the passionate, is natural and expedient; whereas the equality of the two or the rule of the inferior is always hurtful. The same holds good for animals in relation to men; for tame animals have a better nature than wild, and all tame animals are better off when they are ruled by man; for then they are preserved. Again, the male is by nature superior, and the female inferior; and the one rules, and the other is ruled; this principle of necessity extends to all mankind. Where then there is such a difference as that between soul and body, or between men and animals (as is the case of those whose business it is to use their body, and who can do nothing better), the lower sort are by nature slaves, and it is better for them as for all inferiors that they should be under the rule of a master. For he who can be, and therefore is, another&#8217;s and he who participates in rational principle enough to apprehend, but not to have such a principle, is a slave by nature. Whereas the lower animals cannot even apprehend such a principle; they obey their instincts. And indeed the use made of slaves and of tame animals is not very different; for both with their bodies minister to the needs of life&#8230;. It is clear, then, that some men are by nature free and others slaves, and that for these latter slavery is both expedient and right.&#8221; <sup><a href=""#references"">[3]</a></sup></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>What we see here are linked, mutually reinforcing, dualistic categories in the service of various forms of domination, from slavery to misogyny.</p>
                  
                  <p>These dualisms are not just contrasts, or even opposites (like day and night) &#8212; they are radically opposed concepts in a strict hierarchy. Furthermore, as we see in this example from Aristotle, dualisms &#8220;naturalise&#8221; this hierarchy, that is, they make it appear to be &#8220;just the way things are&#8221; (part of their essence or structure &#8212; which is the other main meaning of nature that we discussed earlier). The slave doesn&#8217;t just happen to be a slave, say because she was born into a particular family; she is a slave because she lacks the rationality and civilised bearing of the master &#8212; in some fundamental sense she ought to be a slave.</p>
                  
                  <p>Plumwood sums up these key features of dualisms in the following quote:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>&#8220;Dualism is a relation of separation and domination inscribed and naturalised in culture and characterised by radical exclusion, distancing and opposition between orders constructed as systematically higher and lower, as inferior and superior, as ruler and ruled, which treats the division as part of the natures of beings construed not merely as different but as belonging to radically different orders or kinds, and hence as not open to change.&#8221; <sup><a href=""#references"">[4]</a></sup></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>Understanding dualisms in this more detailed way we are better able to appreciate the complex implications of nature as a conceptual category and its dualistic relationship to the category culture. It should also be clear why scholars interested in issues of domination related to gender, sexuality and race have also taken a strong interest in the nature/culture dualism; this way of characterising the world has implications well beyond what we ordinarily think of as &#8220;environmental&#8221; issues.</p>

"2.8","Implication 4: environmental determinism","Article","","","Week 2","2016-01-18","18 Jan","Week 2: The invention of nature","https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/remaking-nature/1/steps/66146","[<div class=""a-text-context a-text-context--bold-intro"">
                  <p>In the article below, Matthew outlines the problematic, yet influential, theory of &#8220;environmental determinism&#8221; through a discussion of two well-known twentieth century texts. Contemporary examples of environmental determinism are given in the next step.</p>
                  
                  <h2 id=""determinist-trajectories"">Determinist trajectories</h2>
                  <p>A particularly strong lineage that runs through the development of modernist environmental thinking is the theory of environmental determinism &#8212; the broad claim that environmental conditions determine the character and attributes of (geographically distinct) cultural and ethnic groups. While this deeply problematic theory has enjoyed a level of currency throughout Western philosophical and cultural history, it was particularly evident in the early part of the twentieth century, shaping the development of the modern disciplines of area studies, anthropology, geography and environmental studies.</p>
                  
                  <p><em>Civilisation and Climate</em>, a well-known text of this era by Ellsworth Huntington, is a particularly striking example of this genre of environmental thinking. First published in 1915 (and re-printed at least ten times), Huntington&#8217;s text opens with perhaps the clearest expression of environmental and climatic determinism, arguing that &#8220;the races of the earth are like trees. Each according to its kind brings forth the fruit known as civilisation&#8221; <sup><a href=""#references"">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
                  
                  <h2 id=""activity"">Activity</h2>
                  <p>Have a quick browse through the early pages of <a href=""https://archive.org/details/civilizationandc031898mbp"">Huntington&#8217;s work</a>. What do you note about the chapter headings and themes of the book?</p>
                  
                  <p>Huntington&#8217;s race theory is clear from the start. If different races can be distinguished by the sophistication of their culture and civilisation, it is a short step for Huntington to pose his central theory &#8212; that climatic conditions influence the cultural sophistication of different racial and ethnic groups. Perhaps predictably, racial groups residing in temperate climates appear rather positively in Huntington&#8217;s account, while in comparison the &#8220;denizens of the torrid zone are slow and backward, and we almost universally agree that this is connected with the damp, steady heat&#8221; <sup><a href=""#references"">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
                  
                  <p>Huntington&#8217;s climatic determinism is of course a thin veil for a virulent form of Euro-centric racism. It is important to note that Huntington&#8217;s theories of racial superiority are an expression of the emergence of fascist political movements in Europe and America (Huntington was a noted supporter of eugenics and wrote sympathetically about Hitler and the onset of German National Socialism) <sup><a href=""#references"">[3]</a></sup>. They point to a broader geopolitical discourse of Western colonialism that, in the words of Denis Cosgrove, &#8220;sought to base political and military strategy on what were regarded as enduring patterns of lands, seas, climates, and resources across the terrestrial sphere&#8221;. <sup><a href=""#references"">[4]</a></sup></p>
                  
                  <p>Huntington&#8217;s particular mode of reasoning, which seeks to establish the causal relations between environment and civilisation, is by no means unique to the disciplines of geography and environmental science. For example, Peder Anker, in his study of the development of the discipline of ecology &#8212; <em>Imperial Ecology: Environmental Order in the British Empire, 1895&#8211;1945</em> &#8212; demonstrates that the consolidation of the ecology discipline coincided with the final years of the British empire. Anker focuses on two central figures &#8212; the British ecologist George Tansley and the South African Botanist, politician and advocate of racial segregation Jan Christian Smuts &#8212; each of whom deployed ecological thinking to &#8220;solve the empire&#8217;s environmental, social and racial problems&#8221; <sup><a href=""#references"">[5]</a></sup>. Smuts in particular developed an eco-philosophy he termed &#8220;holism&#8221; that influenced the development of botanical science in South Africa and the discipline of ecology more generally. For Smuts:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>Every organism from the lowest microorganism to the highest mind represented a whole, and all these entities were connected into greater wholes, which in turn constituted the greatest whole. <sup><a href=""#references"">[6]</a></sup></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>To this vaguely mystical conception of the unity of the natural world Smuts gave a distinctly political twist, arguing in Anker&#8217;s words that:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>Human freedom is dependent on humans&#8217; place in &#8220;the causal chain of Nature,&#8221; which grants them &#8220;degrees of freedom&#8221; according to the perfection of their respective whole. The organic process of selection caused this degree of freedom. To Smuts the mind is an organ of wholes with the ability to organize a social self and social environment, and an ability that results in &#8220;different levels of culture&#8221; depending on the &#8220;level of mental culture&#8221; and the holistic urge. <sup><a href=""#references"">[7]</a></sup></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>In the same way that Huntington&#8217;s explicitly racist theory of environment sought to establish causal relations between climate and cultural sophistication and expression, in Smut&#8217;s ecological vision everything (both human and nonhuman) has a unique place in a greater whole. The danger for Smuts was when this order was disrupted, which prompted the projects of environmental conservation and racial segregation. In the words of Anker again, Smuts&#8217;</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>ecophilosophy served him as a glorification of white supremacy, with a division of society into high and low personalities, while still defending unification of South Africa, the British Empire, and ultimately the world through the League of Nations. <sup><a href=""#references"">[8]</a></sup></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>One way of reading these connections is simply that they are an expression of the co-joined histories of colonialism and the modern environmental sciences. Might we conclude that the theories of environmental and climatic determinism simply sat alongside the colonial experience but did not add materially to it? Or might we find some comfort in the suggestion that the explicitly racist connotations of both theories were simply a by-product of the personal predilections of their chief proponents? Surely this mode of thinking isn&#8217;t evident in contemporary environmental politics and practice?</p>
                  
                  <p>Of course, in reality the argument that the colonial race theory, ecological holism and environmental determinism were simply accidental bedfellows is a profound mis-reading of entangled histories of these projects.</p>
                  
                  <p>A number of contemporary scholars have begun to identify what we might think of as a &#8220;climatic determinism&#8221; in the public discussion of global warming and climate change. This determinism is characterised by images of climate-induced warfare, conflict and migration. To understand how these legacies are still relevant watch the video of researchers with on-the-ground experience in Sudan and West Africa &#8212; Anne Bartlett and Paul Munro &#8212; in the next step.</p>

                  <p>This week we outlined a range of different understandings of the conceptual development of the concept of nature and arrived at the conclusion that nature, as a European invention, ought to be abandoned.</p>
                  
                  <p>Nature is dead.</p>
                  
                  <p>Of course, this doesn&#8217;t mean chopping down the forests and filling in the mangroves! The end of &#8220;nature&#8221; as a conceptual category might just be the beginning of a more sustainable and ethical engagement with our nonhuman, or more-than-human, world.</p>
                  
                  <p>Four implications of the concept of nature, and the associated nature/culture dualism, were discussed, including:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>mastery over nature</li>
                    <li>nature and power</li>
                    <li>nature as wilderness</li>
                    <li>and environmental determinism.</li>
                  </ul>

"3.2","Learner poll revisited","Article","","","Week 3","2016-01-25","25 Jan","Week 3: Beyond anthropocentrism?","https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/remaking-nature/1/steps/60244","[<div class=""a-text-context a-text-context--bold-intro"">
                  <p>In Week 1, we invited you to participate in a learner poll to help you broadly understand your own values and environmental concerns. In this step Paul Munro reflects on how you all answered and invites you to discuss the results.</p>
                  
                  <p>The poll responses are scored in terms of ecocentric, custodian and anthropocentric responses to help gauge the current perspectives of people in the course.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Ecocentric</strong> &#8211; nature-centred. People with an ecocentric viewpoint tend to see nature as having its own intrinsic value, with a right to exist for its own sake.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Custodian</strong> &#8211; being responsible for the maintenance of something. People with a custodian or stewardship approach to environment tend to feel that humans have a moral obligation to protect nature, both in the present and future.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Anthropocentric</strong> &#8211; human-centred. People with an anthropocentric viewpoint tend to see nature based on its value as a resource to be exploited by humans for human benefit.</p>
                  
                  <p>The purpose of the poll is to make a conceptual point, rather than an empirical one (as arguably surveys are too crude a research instrument to offer a nuanced evaluation of values).</p>
                  
                  <p>What we hope to show is that even among the different people in this course &#8212; who all presumably share some kind of interest in the Environmental Humanities &#8212; there is great diversity in how we view &#8220;nature&#8221; across different themes and issues.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Thanks for taking the poll!</strong>&#160;</p>

"3.3","An Ecomodernist Manifesto","Article","","","Week 3","2016-01-25","25 Jan","Week 3: Beyond anthropocentrism?","https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/remaking-nature/1/steps/60248","[<div class=""a-text-context a-text-context--bold-intro"">
                  <p>In this step, Matthew Kearnes introduces <em>An Ecomodernist Manifesto</em> &#8212; a statement penned by an influential group of environmental thinkers &#8212; to explore anthropocentrism through a contemporary example of a nature-culture dualism.</p>
                  
                  <h2 id=""humans-vs-non-humans-the-great-decoupling"">Humans vs. non-humans: The Great Decoupling?</h2>
                  <p>The most powerful versions of the nature-culture dualism are the ones that are taken for granted and are simply implicit in environmental practices and politics.</p>
                  
                  <p>Occasionally, however, we are given a more explicit illustration of the nature-culture dualism.</p>
                  
                  <p>Take for example the recently released <a href=""http://www.ecomodernism.org"">An Ecomodernist Manifesto</a>.</p>
                  
                  <p>The manifesto is an intriguing read. It was written by a group of leading environmental thinkers including the author of the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Whole-Earth-Discipline-RestoredWildlands-Geoengineering/dp/B005DI7RJ6"">Whole Earth Discipline</a> Stuart Brand, renowned environmental commentator <a href=""http://www.marklynas.org/"">Mark Lynas</a> and the co-founders of the <a href=""http://www.thebreakthrough.org/"">Breakthrough Institute</a>, Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger.</p>
                  
                  <p>Of course as it is a manifesto, its <em>raison d&#8217;&#234;tre</em> is to be provocative. With its support for nuclear power, intensive agriculture and genetically modified crops &#8212; together with the suggestion that &#8220;<a href=""http://thebreakthrough.org/index.php/dialogue/can-we-have-a-good-anthropocene"">positive decoupling trends offer hope for a &#8216;good Anthropocene&#8217;</a>&#8221; &#8212; the manifesto certainly delivers. It questions many of the core issues that have galvanised contemporary environmental campaigns and concerns.</p>
                  
                  <p>It is worth thinking about how the manifesto works conceptually. Its central claim is that humans need to de-couple from nature. The authors open with a striking claim:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>We affirm one long-standing environmental ideal, that humanity must shrink its impacts on the environment to make more room for nature, while we reject another, that human societies must harmonise with nature to avoid economic and ecological collapse. (p. 6)</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>In place of a notion of harmony or environmental balance &#8212; the kinds of ideas that have influenced environmental thinking for nearly forty years &#8212; the authors recommend that</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>Intensifying many human activities &#8212; particularly farming, energy extraction, forestry, and settlement &#8212; so that they use less land and interfere less with the natural world is the key to decoupling human development from environmental impacts. (p. 7)</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>Further into the manifesto the meaning of this notion of decoupling becomes clearer as the authors outline that</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>Decoupling raises the possibility that societies might achieve peak human impact without intruding much further on relatively untouched areas. Nature unused is nature spared. (p. 19)</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>This claim is perhaps one of the clearest expressions of the modernist concept of nature: that the intensification of human activities will enable humans to extricate themselves from relations with nature.</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Discussion:</strong></p>
                  
                    <ul>

                      <li>Are you persuaded by it?</li>
                      <li>Can ecomodernism decouple itself from environmentalism?</li>
                      <li>Can humanity decouple itself from nature?</li>
                      <li>Do you view the manifesto as a contemporary example of a human focused, anthropocentric, understanding of the world?</li>

                  <p>This week we explored some of the problems with anthropocentrism, and offered some helpful ideas for moving beyond it.</p>
                  
                  <p>We introduced <em>An Ecomodernist Manifesto</em> as an example of contemporary perspectives that continue to advocate a human-focused understanding of the world, perpetuating nature-culture divisions. We then asked how we collectively might move beyond anthropocentric notions, through discussions of multispecies communities and the liveliness or agency of things.</p>

                  <p>The aim of your intervention should be to say something interesting, provocative about your issue and its possible futures &#8212; ideally in a way that might make a difference to how people understand and live with this environmental issue.</p>
                  
                  <p>In the following steps we will introduce you to some more examples of different types of creative interventions. As you look at these examples, consider how they relate to the ideas we have been discussing in this course.</p>

                  <p>This week we explored different ways of intervening in and composing new natures.</p>
                  
                  <p>The main aim of this week was to explore how we might put the ideas discussed in this course into practice. How can we both <em>discursively</em> (in the way we write, speak and think) and <em>materially</em> address questions of politics and ethics, history and justice, facts and values? How can we intervene in issues of biodiversity loss, drought, ocean acidification, environmental justice, toxic contamination, mass migration&#8230; ?</p>
                  
                  <p>We were introduced to a range of different possible ways of intervening, including the creation of multispecies communities, eco-criticism and storytelling, bio-art, and artistic representations of nuclear futures. We also created a <a href=""http://padlet.com/unswpad/interventions"">Padlet resource</a> for collecting some creative responses to issues that Environmental Humanities seeks to address.</p>
                  
                  <p>Over the next week we will continue to monitor the Padlet page and the comments in <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/remaking-nature/1/steps/68475"">Step 4.7</a>, in order to see how your different creative responses progress.</p>

                  <p>In the following steps we introduce four different modes or lenses for telling stories within Environmental Humanities:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>environmental justice</li>

                  <p>Each of these storytelling modes offers a different framework for understanding and working through the stories humans tell &#8212; and hence the relationships we establish, with their world-making consequences. Together, these modes can help us to tell new stories that exhibit greater responsibility towards humans and the more-than-human world.</p>
                  
                  <p>As you watch the videos, consider how these four different lenses might help you to reframe ideas about your <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/remaking-nature/1/steps/68473"">chosen environmental issue</a>.</p>

"5.10","Migration and climate-induced flooding","Discussion","","","Week 5","2016-02-08","8 Feb","Week 5: New narratives for new natures","https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/remaking-nature/1/steps/68708","[<div class=""a-text-context a-text-context--bold-intro"">
                  <p>In this step, Mathew Kearnes critiques representations of climate-induced migration in mass media, building on notions of environmental determinism discussed in <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/remaking-nature/1/steps/66146"">Step 2.8</a>. After you have read Matthew&#8217;s critique, we will ask you to consider how a different story about climate change migration might be told using the storytelling modes discussed this week.</p>
                  
                  <p>Let&#8217;s have a look at some of the images through which climate-induced migration is depicted.</p>
                  
                  <p>Images of floods abound in the literature on climate change, and one of the most common assumptions made is that rising seas levels, and flooded landscapes, will lead to &#8220;floods of people&#8221; forced to migrate, precipitating resource conflict and security threats.</p>
                  
                  <p>One particularly interesting example of the ways in which climate-induced flooding is figured as a cause of social threat was the London Futures Climate Change Exhibition, which featured fictional depictions of London by illustrators Robert Graves and Didier Madoc-Jones. The exhibition, hosted by the Museum of London in 2011, was <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2010/oct/27/london-futures-exhibition"">featured in the Guardian newspaper</a>.</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Activity:</strong>
                  Have a look at the <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2010/oct/27/london-futures-exhibition"">exhibition</a>:</p>
                  
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <p>What do you feel when you see these images?</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>What modernist conceptions of nature do you think are evident in these images?</p>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>With images of flooded iconic London landmarks like the Thames Barrier, Parliament Square and Piccadilly Circus, the exhibition was clearly designed to be provocative and challenging.</p>
                  
                  <p>However, with images of Parliament Square transformed into a rice paddy, and a climate shanty town around Buckingham palace, the exhibition is also indicative of the ways in which images of environmental change are interpreted socially and politically. In <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2010/oct/27/london-futures-climate-change-exhibition"">response</a> to the exhibition George Marshall, founder of the <a href=""http://www.climateoutreach.org.uk/"">Climate Outreach Information Network</a>, argued that:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>The greatest concern with this show is not that it parts with reality, but that it speaks all too well to real prejudices against immigrants &#8220;swamping&#8221; British culture.</p>
                  
                    <p>This is a recurring theme.</p>
                  
                    <p>One postcard shows Asian peasants working in paddy fields in the shadow of Big Ben. Two postcards in the series show shantytowns around Nelson&#8217;s Column and Buckingham Palace.</p>
                  
                    <p>These images cause deep disquiet for those who work with refugees and immigrants. &#8230; These concerns are exacerbated by the language used in the captions. The caption for the Buckingham Palace shantytown talks of the royal family being surrounded by &#8220;overwhelming numbers of immigrants&#8221;. Another caption, for a picture of monkeys on the balustrade of St Paul&#8217;s Cathedral describes them as &#8220;a new breed of tropical immigrants reminiscing about equatorial days.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>In a similar fashion Hannah Smith, also based at the Climate Outreach and Information Network, responded to the exhibition by arguing that:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>The actual patterns of migration are far more likely to be the movement of people inside existing national borders or, in the case of the UK, from within the European Union. To suggest that there will be mass migration from the [global] south is misleading and feeds xenophobia.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>There are two aspects of this &#8216;migrant flood narrative&#8217; which are crucial.</p>
                  
                  <p>Firstly there is a determinist argument here that suggests that environmental change leads inextricably to social outcomes in ways that deny the material histories of colonialism, geopolitics, human movement and environmental vulnerability.</p>
                  
                  <p>Secondly, the figure of the climate migrant, is typically cast as a threat to security and normally to Western security.  In a recent article entitled: <a href=""http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=a45388"">&#8216;Racialisation and the figure of the climate-change migrant&#8217;</a>  the geographer Andrew Baldwin summarises some of the ways in which we might see in the thinking around of climate-induced migration the legacies of earlier models of environmental determinism. He argues:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>Migration is by now a standard element of climate-change discourse. However, its meaning within climate-change discourse is ever-shifting and open to continuous reconfiguration. It is prevalent, for instance, in accounts that frame climate change as a field of geopolitical security. In such accounts, the so-called &#8216;climate-change migrant&#8217; is commonly figured as a threat to various forms of security. &#8230; The thesis broadly holds that climate-change-induced migrations could result in outbreaks of violent conflict in places where resources are scarce. Here, the reasoning is that migrants will place additional demands on resources that are either already allocated or under severe pressure from degradation and overuse and, thus, come into conflict with preexisting resource users.</p>
                  
                    <p>Migration is also found in accounts that frame climate change as a humanitarian issue. In such accounts, the climate-change migrant is commonly figured as a victim of or vulnerable to climate change. This is the migrant-as-victim thesis, and one of its central narratives is that the migrant or potential migrant is at risk of losing his or her human-rights protections. In this version of the migrant-as-victim thesis, climate-change-induced migration is framed as a problem resolvable through better law.</p>
                  
                    <p>However, it is the dual construction of the migrant, as threat and victim, that should alert us to the presence of racial power within climate change and migration discourse. This is for two reasons. First, the labels &#8216;threat&#8217; and &#8216;victim&#8217; are what mark the migrant as different from some purportedly normal, unmarked body. And second, both authorise some form of moral intervention&#8212;whether increased policing or humanitarian assistance. In other words &#8230; the racial Other is conceived in the language of threat and victimhood and that its status as such is normally said to be a function of some innate quality rather than of its denied history or awkward positioning in anachronistic space.</p>

                  <p>This week we looked at the power of storytelling in composing new natures.</p>
                  
                  <p>We encountered the recurring idea that telling stories draws us into new connections, accountabilities and obligations. You invented your own creative stories about the future through the Game of Global Futures, which illustrated how different connections, or coalescences, lead to different environmental outcomes.</p>
                  
                  <p>Finally, we provided a toolkit of four different modes for creating new narratives for new natures: justice, care, art and democratising knowledge.</p>

                  <p>Welcome to the final week of the course.</p>
                  
                  <p>We hope that you&#8217;ve enjoyed engaging in conversations about environmental issues and have gained an appreciation for how Environmental Humanities is responding to the environmental challenges of our time.</p>
                  
                  <p>For our final week we will make a short foray into the need for value, care and responsibility in worlds of the future. We start by looking at artworks by the Australian artist Patricia Piccinini.</p>
                  
                  <h2 id=""activity"">Activity</h2>
                  
                  <p>Check out <a href=""http://www.multispecies-salon.org/piccinini/"">Piccinini&#8217;s artworks</a> on the Multispecies Salon and read <a href=""http://www.multispecies-salon.org/haraway/"">this short text</a> by Donna Haraway.</p>
                  
                  <p>As Haraway explains, Piccinini&#8217;s creations are &#8220;genetically modified extraterrestrials&#8221; created by humans to protect Australian animals on the edge of extinction. Piccinini&#8217;s artistic worlds of the future provokes discussion about humans&#8217; duty of care towards their technocultural creations and provides an interesting opportunity to discuss the potential impacts of science and technology on our everyday lives.</p>
                  
                  <p>In describing Piccinini&#8217;s work, Haraway writes:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>[Piccinini is] committed to taking &#8216;naturecultures&#8217; seriously without the soporific seductions of a return to Eden or the palpitating frisson of a jeremiad warning of the coming technological Apocalypse&#8230;.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>Instead, Piccinini&#8217;s worlds incorporate ideas of hope, care, and &#8220;responsive attentiveness&#8221; <sup><a href=""#references"">[1]</a></sup>. As Donna Haraway explains,</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>Piccinini insists in word and object that the people of technoculture have a familial, generational duty to their failures, as well as their accomplishments. Natural or not, good or not, safe or not, the critters of technoculture make a body- and soul-changing claim on their &#8220;creators&#8221; that is rooted in the generational obligation of and capacity for responsive attentiveness. To care is to know how to nurture quiet country through the often unexpected generations, not to point toward future utopia or dystopia. To care is wet, emotional, messy, and demanding of the best thinking one has ever done. That is one reason we need speculative fabulation. <sup><a href=""#references"">[2]</a></sup></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>The concept of &#8220;responsive attentiveness,&#8221; quoted above, is drawn from Deborah Bird Rose&#8217;s scholarship on the violence of white &#8220;settler&#8221; histories in Australia and reflects on decolonising practices. Deb proposes replacing violence with an attentiveness and obligation to relationships among people and between people, other species and place (p. 5).</p>

                  <p>We hope you have gained an appreciation of what work in the emerging field of Environmental Humanities can achieve and feel inspired to pursue other ways of getting involved in the remaking of natures.</p>
                  
                  <p>At the outset of this course we discussed the need to look beyond the natural sciences, beyond economics, to find solutions to our current environmental problems that are not only sustainable, but also creative, democratic and just.</p>
                  
                  <p>As teaching, research, activism and creative collaborations in the Environmental Humanities continue to expand we are developing a broad range of tools, interventions and approaches. This work is already making a dynamic contribution to a much larger environmental movement, while also drawing this movement into critical dialogue with various justice movements to work towards better futures for everyone.</p>
                  
                  <p>In participating in this course you will have noticed the broad transdisciplinarity of the Environmental Humanities. During the previous weeks we have drawn on research and approaches from subfields and disciplines including philosophy, art, history, anthropology and more.</p>
                  
                  <p>From a certain perspective then the label &#8220;environmental humanities&#8221; might be understood as an umbrella term: a gathering up of a range of distinct qualitative approaches to the environment. But this is not really the approach we have taken in this course. Instead, we have aimed to break down borders between these diverse fields, to mix together different methods of understanding, of communicating, of intervening, and in so doing to explore a genuinely transdisciplinary approach. It is through precisely this kind of transdisciplinarity that the humanities can contribute most powerfully &#8212; that is, critically and creatively &#8212; to the shaping of a better world.</p>
                  
                  <p>Thank you for your participation. Please help us to improve the course, and let us know how we did, by taking our <a href=""https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/FL_UNSW_EH_1_post"">end-of-course survey</a>.</p>
