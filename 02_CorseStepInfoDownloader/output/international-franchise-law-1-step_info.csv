                  <p>There will be learning activities such as discussion and quizzes on key issues and challenges that emerge through the 6 scenarios presented where you will be asked to discuss these and identify strategies, ideas and ways to respond effectively.</p>
                  
                  <p>You will be able to access relevant resources and guest legal experts&#8217; views to further guide you in your decision making process, as you would be in real life context.</p>

                  <p>Rupert Barkoff, one of our international franchise law experts, recalled a deal he was involved in where a soft ice-cream brand originating in the United States expanded to Japan.</p>
                  
                  <p>The US franchisor quite obviously did not undertake their due diligence as soft ice-cream was synonymous with a &#8216;sissy&#8217; product by Japanese consumers. The product was a complete failure. In an effort to save their brand and investment, the marketing team cleverly came up with an advertising campaign that had Japanese sumo-wrestlers eating the soft ice-cream. In Japanese culture, sumo wrestlers are synonymous with strength and honour. The image of these revered national icons consuming the soft ice-cream made the product more appealing to the greater consumer base.</p>

                  <p>Franchisors use operating manuals and franchise agreements to guide franchisees on how to run their business.</p>
                  
                  <p>Operating Manuals provide detailed descriptions on processes for running the business. The franchisor creates templates for all paperwork such as invoices, quotes, orders and daily job sheets and provides information on how the business manages employees, customers and suppliers &#8211; as well as locations and landlords.</p>
                  
                  <p>Franchise agreements set out the legal obligations of the franchisor and the franchisee towards each other. Sections on territory, franchisor obligations and franchisee obligations are typically included.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Territory</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>Then there will be a statement that the franchisor grants rights to the franchisee. These rights will be to an exclusive or non-exclusive territory if the franchisor decides also to operate in the territories. Not all franchisors grant territories. Where franchisors do not grant territories you would expect them to only locate new franchisees where they would not destroy the business of an adjacent franchisee. The franchisor also needs to consider whether it will make sales online and how this will have an impact on sales within a franchisee&#8217;s territory.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Franchisors obligation</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>These would typically relate to the provision to the franchisee of the operations manual, to providing initial training, maintaining the intellectual property, documenting the franchisee&#8217;s agreement to allow the franchisor to sell its entire system without the franchisee&#8217;s approval, and its right to require the franchisee to update its business from time to time.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Franchisee&#8217;s obligations</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>This is always a much longer list than the franchisor&#8217;s obligations. The broad themes that are covered are money, standards, reporting requirements, advertising commitments, role in using and reporting misuse of intellectual property, requirements on transfer of the franchisee&#8217;s business, termination provisions, during-the-term and post-term restrictive covenants, provision of guarantees, and insurance.</p>
                  
                  <p>We then come to the final three structural elements of the Franchise Agreements. These are mutual obligations, boilerplate provisions, and guarantee and indemnity provisions. Mutual obligations include dispute resolution systems appropriate to the jurisdiction and cooling off rights if applicable. Boilerplate provisions include identifying the jurisdiction and the law for resolution of dispute, acts of God (such as flood, hurricane, tsunami, fire) and confidentiality. Finally, guarantee and indemnity provisions are where the franchisee&#8217;s directors (assuming the franchisee is a company) personally guarantee the performance of all obligations the franchisee has committed to.</p>

                  <p>In Week 3, we check up on Michelle and Brian&#8217;s progress again. By now it is dawning on them that they need to think about the law. Then we start looking at a range of laws that international franchisors need to be aware of. Our experts will tell us how they see lawyers can add value to franchisors considering international expansion. We certainly look forward to your input too.</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Understand that expansion may be to a country with a different legal system to the home jurisdiction. These include jurisdictions adhering to common law, civil law, customary law or religious law systems or a combination of legal systems.</li>
                      <li>Recognise that the business model may be regulated through franchise-specific laws or general commercial laws depending on the jurisdiction.  There may also be business registration or disclosure registration requirements.</li>
                      <li>Understand differing franchisor attitudes towards international expansion.</li>
                      <li>Identify the strategies available to grow a domestic franchised operation and the laws in host jurisdictions that may impact on the franchisors choice of expansion model.</li>
                      <li>Recognise the general laws that apply to franchise activity. For example consumer protection, intellectual property, competition laws, tax, workplace health and safety.</li>

                  <p>This week we will explore the critically important matter of property. Intellectual property is a key component of the franchisor&#8217;s offering, and some franchisors also have expansive real property interests. Property interests need legal protection so join us to find out what legal rights need protection, and what the experts recommend doing when the desired level of protection is not available.</p>
                  
                  <p>After participating in the learning activities for this week, you will be able to:</p>

                  <p>In Week 5, Michelle and Brian recognise that disputes will arise in even the best relationships. Franchising is no exception. Disputes involving franchisors/master franchisees/area developers/franchisees/third parties can cost a business time, money and reputation. This week we&#8217;ll see how franchising disputes are managed from country to country. Our experts will add their valuable perspectives on what has worked for them. We&#8217;re keen to learn about what has, or has not worked for you too.</p>
