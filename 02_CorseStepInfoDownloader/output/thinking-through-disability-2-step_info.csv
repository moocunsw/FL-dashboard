                  <p>Now that you know what topics we will cover, let&#8217;s go into a little more detail about the different ways you can choose to engage with this course.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""accessing-course-content"">Accessing course content</h3>
                  
                  <p>There are several ways to access the course content, and we encourage you to use whatever modes of content work best for you.</p>
                  
                  <p>We provide:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>interactive video transcripts</strong> (expandable on the page)</li>
                      <li><strong>closed captions</strong> (enabled through the video player)</li>
                      <li><strong>pdf transcripts for media</strong> (downloadable from the bottom of each step)</li>

                      <li><strong>mp3 audio files for all media</strong> (available at the bottom of each step)</li>
                      <li><strong>audio descriptions for some videos</strong> (accessible from the bottom of these steps)</li>
                    </ul>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>Enrolled participants will be able to access the course even after it has officially ended. Many of you may choose to follow along with us week by week, but don&#8217;t worry if you fall behind. We encourage you to complete the course over whatever time period works best for you.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""navigating-the-course"">Navigating the course</h3>
                  
                  <p>There are sections in each week of the course labelled &#8220;basics&#8221;, &#8220;expanding your interests&#8221; and &#8220;extending your knowledge&#8221;.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Basics</strong> steps are those we consider <strong>foundational</strong> for understanding and thinking through disability. These steps include a wide variety of activities, readings and discussions.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Expanding your interests</strong> steps are about increasing the <strong>breadth</strong> of your awareness. Activities in these steps focus on personal reflection and discussing your ideas with others.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Extending your knowledge</strong> steps go into greater <strong>depth</strong> about some of the concepts, theories and methods that can help you to think more critically about disability.</p>
                  
                  <p>Many of you may choose to move through the course step-by-step, in a linear sequence. But feel free to choose your own pathway through the course based on your own personal interests. For example, you might want to skip over the extending your knowledge steps entirely!</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>IMPORTANT: Expanding your interests</strong> and <strong>Extending your knowledge</strong> steps appear towards the end of each week. Sometimes we will give you the option to jump ahead to one of these steps, as it expands on or extends the ideas of the step you have just done. If you do decide to skip ahead, make sure you backtrack to finish all the steps you might have missed, by following the &#8220;Back to basics&#8221; links. You can mark each step as &#8220;complete&#8221; to help you keep track of which steps you have done.</p>

This is a personalised certificate and transcript, detailing the syllabus and learning outcomes from the course. It comes as a printed certificate as well as a digital version which you can add to your LinkedIn profile. To qualify for a Certificate of Achievement for this course, you must have marked at least 90% of the steps in the course as complete.</p>
                  
                  <p>There is also the option to purchase a personalised <a href=""/courses/thinking-through-disability/2/statement-of-participation"">Statement of Participation</a>, to celebrate taking part. To be eligible for the Statement of Participation, you must mark at least 50% of the steps on the course as complete. This also comes in a printed and digital format and you can add it to your LinkedIn profile.</p>

                  <p>To help make sense of all these options, here are some examples of how different people might choose to engage with the course:</p>

She has a son with a disability and is really interested in understanding how disability plays out across the life course.</strong> Glenda decides to take the course on her mobile phone during her commute. She reads the video transcripts and tries to get through at least the <strong>basics</strong> steps in most weeks of the course. In <em>Week 4: Disability across the life course</em>, Glenda makes sure to complete the <strong>expanding your interests</strong> steps too.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p><strong>Rodrigo is a father studying full time to become a disability researcher and wants to get a more critical perspective on disability studies.</strong> Rodrigo downloads the audio files to his playlist and listens to them as he prepares dinner. In the evenings, he works through the course, picking and choosing the steps that sound most interesting, but spending most of his time on the  <strong>extending your knowledge</strong> steps. Rodrigo decides to purchase a Certificate of Achievement as evidence of his learning.</p>

She skims the other content, which she sometimes finds really useful, and prints out materials that she can take home with her to read.</p>

                  <p>We&#8217;ll be relating our ideas in this course to the theme of living a good life. So let&#8217;s begin by exploring what living a good life means for you.</p>
                  
                  <p>Make a list of all the phrases that immediately come to your mind when you think about living a good life. Initially, you might find that general ideas like &#8220;my family&#8221; or &#8220;my health&#8221; come to mind.</p>
                  
                  <p>Over the next few days, as you go about living your life, other things might come to mind. Maybe when you are standing under the shower you realise that just being under a stream of hot water makes you feel &#8220;alive&#8221;; or when you&#8217;re talking to a friend, you realise that talking to, listening to and being with someone you love is also part of having a good life.</p>
                  
                  <p>Now it&#8217;s time to share your thoughts on living a good life. Click on the &#8220;Join the discussion&#8221; link below to contribute to the conversation.</p>
                  
                  <p>Throughout this course we provide &#8220;Talking points&#8221;. While these prompts are useful for guiding your thinking, please don&#8217;t feel like you need to respond to them directly.</p>

                  <p>If you&#8217;d like to monitor the impact of this course on the way you think about disability, you can complete our Thinking Through Disability survey.</p>
                  
                  <p>The survey contains two sets of questions to help you unpack and reflect on your current ideas about disability:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <p><strong>First, there are two open-ended questions about your understanding of disability now.</strong> While these might be difficult to answer, we really encourage you to get into these questions, as they will probably allow you to express complex ideas about your thoughts and attitudes.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p><strong>Next, there is a series of questions reflecting different attitudes towards people with disabilities.</strong> These are adapted from an attitudinal survey that has been used internationally since 1966. You will notice that while these questions are thought provoking, it is often very difficult to just tick a box! You might find yourself wanting to explain your answers.</p>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>You will have the opportunity to complete the same survey again at the end of the course, to track any changes in your thoughts about disability as a result of doing the course.</p>
                  
                  <p>We provide a link to the online survey below (click &#8216;launch&#8217;). At the end of the survey, you will receive an email with a record of your responses. There is also a pdf version of the survey in the Downloads section below, in case you prefer to print it and complete it offline.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""would-you-like-to-contribute-to-our-research"">Would you like to contribute to our research?</h3>
                  
                  <p>This is one of three surveys in the course. If you&#8217;re interested, you can complete these online surveys as a participant in our research study. The research will help us understand:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <ul>
                      <li>what motivates people to do an online course on disability;</li>
                      <li>whether the course is accessible to diverse learners;</li>
                      <li>how thinking about disability changes when you do a course on disability.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>We will publish the research findings in a peer-reviewed journal and you&#8217;ll be able to find them on the <a href=""https://www.arts.unsw.edu.au/research/intellectual-disability-behaviour-support-program/"">UNSW Intellectual Disability Behaviour Support website</a>.</p>
                  
                  <p>When you open the online survey, you will have the option to opt in to the research. Participating in the research is entirely optional. If you choose not to participate, you will still be able to complete the online survey for your own personal benefit.</p>
                  
                  <p>More information about the research is provided in our <a href=""https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/files/56/b5/56b5ccdb-f856-457a-a119-795ef524f5ee/PARTICIPATION_INFORMATION_STATEMENT_-_THINKING_THROUGH_DISABILITY-02.pdf"">Participant Information Statement</a>.</p>

                  <p><em><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Some learners have reported problems loading the survey. We apologise for the inconvenience and are currently investigating this issue. It may help to wait for the page to load, or try launching the survey again.</em></p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""next-steps"">Next steps</h3>
                  
                  <p>In Week 2 of the course, we will be investigating what it means to count and measure disability. As we&#8217;ve been discussing this week, attitudes are a big part of how people are disabled. It would be a good introduction for next week to think about this survey as an example of the difficulties in counting and measuring disability.</p>
                  
                  <p>For example, we adapted some of our survey questions from a 1966 survey. While this enables us to examine how the attitudes of learners in this course compare to those in other places and at other times, you may have noticed that these questions also have some real limitations.

                  <p>In this step we introduce two different ways of thinking about disability &#8212; the medical model and the social model. If you already know these models well, you can skip ahead to the next section.</p>
                  
                  <p>Prior to the 1970s, particularly in the English-speaking world, the prevailing view was that individuals with impairments needed to be &#8220;fixed&#8221; (if possible) through medical intervention. This view is sometimes called the <strong>medical model</strong> of disability.</p>
                  
                  <p>In the 1970s and 1980s, activists and scholars started questioning the assumptions of the medical model. They argued instead for a <strong>&#8220;social model&#8221;</strong> of disability, where disability is seen to arise as a result of physical, organisational and attitudinal barriers in society. Importantly, the social model of disability also made a divide between two different concepts &#8212; impairment and disability.</p>
                  
                  <p>In the next step, you will hear Eric Emerson describe his viewpoint on the differences between impairment and disability.</p>
                  
                  <p>We will refer to the social and medical models throughout this course. We unpack these ideas a bit more in the next few steps, and the <a href=""https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/files/9d/da/9ddaee95-7809-4f45-a889-e74d0ad46f1f/Glossary_21_October_2016.pdf"">glossary</a> also has explanations of these core concepts.</p>

                  <p>Gathering useful statistics does require shared definitions and labels. But trying to classify every single impairment into a checklist, as a stable series of &#8220;facts&#8221;, is obviously a very difficult task.</p>
                  
                  <p>One attempt to classify disability is the <a href=""http://www.who.int/classifications/icf/en/"">International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health</a> (ICF), developed by the World Health Organisation (WHO). This framework is an attempt to provide a basic worldwide standard for measuring disability and health, and it considers both the medical and social aspects of impairment and disability.</p>
                  
                  <p>The WHO publishes an &#8220;ICF checklist&#8221; covering the major categories of the ICF. The checklist was developed as a practical tool to assist in measuring levels of health and disability.</p>
                  
                  <p>Follow the link to the ICF checklist below, and try to fill it in for yourself &#8212; whether you would count yourself as disabled or not. You can start with number A.1 on the form.</p>

                  <p>Now that you have seen how people are classified and labelled, let&#8217;s discuss how people challenge the labels they have been given.</p>
                  
                  <p>Last week you looked at some common attitudes that assume people with disabilities are passive and unattractive, pitiful, shameful and frightening. You have also seen how disabled people are challenging the insensitivity and discrimination these attitudes create &#8212; often by challenging or reclaiming definitions of disability.</p>
                  
                  <p>In much of the English-speaking world words like &#8220;cripple&#8221;, &#8220;retarded&#8221;, and &#8220;handicapped&#8221; are no longer commonly used to describe disability. Alternative terms come in and out of fashion in different places. For example in England the current trend is to say &#8220;disabled people&#8221;, yet in Australia, it is &#8220;people with disabilities&#8221;. English people tend to say &#8220;people with learning difficulties&#8221;, while Australians tend to use &#8220;people with intellectual disabilities&#8221;.</p>
                  
                  <p>And some people labeled as disabled reclaim the term as a positive one. As we saw in <a href=""/courses/thinking-through-disability/2/steps/109672"">Step 2.5: Disability - A badge or label?</a>, people who define themselves as Deaf for example, and who use sign language, would argue that they are not disabled at all, but a linguistic minority, with a rich culture.</p>
                  
                  <p>At the same time, disabled activists and scholars are coming up with alternative terms for some impairments. Many people now use words that used to be insulting in a positive way, such as crip or supercrip. Others are inventing new terms such as misfit and normate. They have also thought up other names for people who consider themselves &#8220;able-bodied&#8221; or normal. The use of the term non-disabled is intended to deliberately reverse standard labeling. Words like neuro-typical, a term used by some people with Asperger&#8217;s and autism, turn the insult around and aim it at &#8220;normal&#8221; people. They argue that it is neuro-typicals who suffer from too much emotion and a lack of order in their lives. To learn more about this, follow the link to Rosie King&#8217;s TED Talk in the See Also section below.</p>

                  <p>In this step we will think further about the boundaries around who is and who isn&#8217;t included in this category of disability.</p>
                  
                  <p>So far in the course, we have seen that people with disabilities often have mixed feelings about identifying with having an impairment and with being a part of the/a disability community. While the disability rights movement collects people with diverse impairments together as sharing a form of oppression, the social category of &#8220;people with disabilities&#8221;  or &#8220;disabled people&#8221; has unclear boundaries. This lack of clarity can have implications for people&#8217;s identification, experiences of impairment and for the supports they receive.</p>
                  
                  <p>While some people might challenge labels as we saw in <a href=""/courses/thinking-through-disability/2/steps/109674"">Step 2.7: Challenging labels</a>, others may not have been given a diagnosed label and/or identify with having an impairment or seen as disabled by society. Others still might feel like they don&#8217;t belong to the disability community, because they do not recognise their experience as a disability, because they &#8220;pass&#8221; as able-bodied or because they only have their impairment some of the time. There are also others who, because of the nature of their impairment, such as those who are severely mentally unwell or cognitively impaired, may not be conscious that disabiity labels apply to them.</p>
                  
                  <p>In making this course, we interviewed UK disabled artist Zoe Partington. In the excerpt from our interview below, Zoe describes herself as having two impairments, and explains how the different manifestations of these impairments have affected how she has identified, acknowledged and lived with them:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><em>I was a disabled person at the age of four, but then I didn&#8217;t really recognise I was a disabled person until a lot later, when I gained a second impairment. And at that point, I began to see that you were treated differently if you had a visible disability to if you had a hidden disability or impairment.</em></p>
                  
                    <p><em>And I think I began to notice that in some ways, if you have a hidden impairment, you sort of pretend to try and be normal and fit in, because then you&#8217;re not challenged or questioned, or you&#8217;re not discriminated against&#8230;.If you&#8217;re a visibly disabled person, there are a lot of other challenges where you are discriminated against&#8230;in work, in careers and education. And I think it can be difficult. But then there are some positive things where if you&#8217;re a person with a hidden impairment&#8230; you struggle and try to pretend to be normal, and that tires you out and it can get very demanding on you, and you don&#8217;t sort of let go and acknowledge that it&#8217;s affecting you in a certain way. And I think at some point, if you become more confident, you&#8217;re able to sort of challenge that notion and then start to say to people, &#8216;actually you can&#8217;t see my impairment but I can&#8217;t do that, I need more information or I need access solutions to enable me to be successful like everyone else.&#8217;</em></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>In this excerpt, Zoe points to some of the dilemmas around disability classification. As we discussed in Week 1, there are strong societal ideas about what disability is and what it looks like. Thus there is often less understanding about the kinds of access solutions or supports necessary for people with &#8220;invisible&#8221; or episodic impairments to live good lives. This is particularly true for people with a mental health history who have been labeled with psychosocial or psychiatric disabilities.</p>
                  
                  <p>UK disabled activist and artist, Liz Crow, articulates this link between dis/ability, visibility and support beautifully in her more recent work. In her paper, &#8220;<a href=""http://www.roaring-girl.com/work/austerity-bites/"">Austerity Bites: Disability and the Summer of 2012</a>&#8221;, she suggests that the visibility of disability in the London Paralympics created a particular kind of public disability literacy, which resulted in problems for people with other forms of disability. In this case, public disability literacy focused on the supercrip &#8212; the disabled person who could do everything and more. In this UK, this disability literacy coincided with austerity, or the reduction of government expenditures. With images of supercrips saturating the media, the UK public were asked to hunt out &#8220;inauthentic&#8221; people with disabilities who were &#8220;scrounging&#8221; off benefits &#8212; people who did not fit the general public&#8217;s ideas of what disability looked like. In this way, everyone was invited to monitor and make boundaries around what was and what wasn&#8217;t a legitimate way of being disabled.</p>
                  
                  <p>Crow&#8217;s main point (and she has many) is that the way in which disability is understood has significant implications for how a diversity of people are supported. In other words, placing firm boundaries around who is and who isn&#8217;t disabled fails to consider the intersections and interactions in a person&#8217;s life which make their impairment disabling &#8212; or not.</p>
                  
                  <p>In the downloads below, we provide an audio clip (with transcript) of Rosemarie Garland-Thomson that extends some of these ideas.</p>

                  <p>From 1790 to the present day, the U.S. has conducted a national census every 10 years. Census records are generally created so that governments can understand and anticipate future needs. For example, how many people can be expected to enter and leave the workforce in the next 10 years? How many people can be expected to fight in the armed forces? How much new housing will be needed to accommodate population growth?</p>
                  
                  <p>Looking at how disability was counted in a region over time can give some insight into changing attitudes, beliefs, values, needs and circumstances. Let&#8217;s look at how disability was counted in the U.S. from 1790 - 2000.</p>
                  
                  <p>Read through the ways disability was counted in each year of the U.S. decennial census and note any trends or general observations. At the end of this step, you will have an opportunity to discuss your observations with others.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id=""section""><strong>1790 - 1840</strong></h4>
                  
                  <p>No information about disability was collected in censuses during these years.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id=""section-1""><strong>1850 - 1860</strong></h4>
                  
                  <p>The instructions for census enumerators were as follows:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>&#8220;The assistant marshal should ascertain if there be any person in the family deaf, dumb, idiotic, blind, insane, or pauper. If so, who? And insert the term &#8216;deaf and dumb&#8217;, &#8216;blind&#8217;, &#8216;insane&#8217;, and &#8216;idiotic&#8217;, opposite the name of such persons, as the fact may be.&#8221;</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>Disability status during these years was reported in the same column as pauper and convict status; however, disability was based on self-reporting, while convict status was gleaned from county records, so as not to offend families.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id=""section-2""><strong>1870</strong></h4>
                  
                  <p>In 1870, &#8220;Deaf and dumb, Blind, Insane, or Idiotic&#8221; was now its own category. The instructions were revised:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>&#8220;Great care will be taken in performing this work of enumeration, so as at once to secure completeness and avoid giving offense. Total blindness and undoubted insanity only are intended in this inquiry. Deafness merely, without the loss of speech, is not to be reported. The fact of idiocy will be better determined by the common consent of the neighborhood, than by attempting to apply any scientific measure to the weakness of the mind or will.&#8221;</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <h4 id=""section-3""><strong>1880</strong></h4>
                  
                  <p>The 1880 census is notable, as it captured more detailed information about individuals and families. This was also true in respect to disability. Five separate categories now appeared under the broad heading of &#8220;health&#8221;:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Deaf and Dumb;</li>
                      <li>Blind;</li>
                      <li>Idiotic;</li>
                      <li>Insane;</li>
                      <li>Maimed, Crippled, Bedridden, or otherwise disabled.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>Individuals falling under any of these categories were to be included in the Defective, Dependent and Delinquent Schedules. Here, the &#8220;defective&#8221; class was divided into idiots and the insane; the &#8220;dependent&#8221; class into deaf-mutes and the blind; and the &#8220;delinquent&#8221; class into orphans, paupers and convicts. Additionally, the enumerator was instructed to ask whether any person was sick or temporarily disabled, and what the sickness or disability was.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id=""section-4""><strong>1890</strong></h4>
                  
                  <p>In 1890, two categories appeared:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Whether suffering from acute or chronic disease, with name of disease and length of time afflicted</li>
                      <li>Whether defective in mind, sight, hearing, or speech, or whether crippled, maimed, or deformed, with name of defect</li>
                    </ul>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <h4 id=""section-5""><strong>1900 - 1910</strong></h4>
                  
                  <p>In 1900, disability was not counted, and in 1910, only two categories appeared: whether deaf and dumb, and whether blind (both eyes).</p>
                  
                  <h4 id=""section-6""><strong>1920 - 1960</strong></h4>
                  
                  <p>In these years, disability was not explicitly counted. However, a range of new questions about work status and reasons for unemployment were added, as well as questions about access to clean water and the forms of transportation people took to work.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id=""section-7""><strong>1970 - 1990</strong></h4>
                  
                  <p>In this period, several new questions appeared on U.S. censuses. These questions related to the limiting of work due to disability, the ability to use public transport, and the ability to leave the home and bathe, dress and feed oneself independently.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id=""section-8""><strong>2000</strong></h4>
                  
                  <p>Here, in addition to questions about work and independence, we see questions relating to blindness, deafness and limitation of physical activity, as well as to difficulty learning, remembering and concentrating.</p>

                  <p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is the main reference tool used to diagnose psychiatric and mental health disorders.</p>
                  
                  <p>In the 13 years between the publication of the DSM4 (2000) and DSM5 (2013) there were significant changes in the definitions and classifications of certain impairments and therefore the supports that they would or wouldn&#8217;t attract.</p>

"2.14","Reflecting on the counting of disability","Article","","","Week 2","2016-10-31","31 Oct","Week 2: Who counts as disabled?","https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/thinking-through-disability/2/steps/109681","[<div class=""a-text-context a-text-context--bold-intro"">
                  <p>This week you have been introduced to some of the tensions around labelling disability, and gathering data on disability. We have raised questions about where and how disability is counted and why counting is important and at times problematic.</p>
                  
                  <p>We started the week by investigating some of the official global statistics about disability. Hopefully you managed to find statistics in your local context and discuss these with other learners.</p>
                  
                  <p>We then turned to thinking about how labelling, classification and counting can be complex. In particular we reflected on how labelling/badging/classification/counting of disability can:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <ul>
                      <li>play a crucial role in identity formation (e.g. Deaf culture);</li>
                      <li>be a detriment to someone&#8217;s sense of their ability;</li>
                      <li>inform the development of policy, programs and support;</li>
                      <li>encourage resistance, creativity and possibility;</li>
                      <li>require complex negotiations by disabled people as they navigate the various ways in which statistics are used.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>So while it is important, classification itself is not neutral &#8212; it involves particular biases and perspectives that change over time, that affect different disabilities and impairments in different ways, and that are influenced by power relations between those being counted and those doing the counting.</p>
                  
                  <p>In thinking about who counts as having a disability, some of the examples this week have highlighted the importance of understanding how views of disability have changed through time. Next week we look at the history of disability in more depth.</p>

"3.5","A brief history of the freak show","Article","","","Week 3","2016-11-07","7 Nov","Week 3: Disability histories","https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/thinking-through-disability/2/steps/109660","[<div class=""a-text-context a-text-context--bold-intro"">
                  <p>&#8220;People who are visually different have always provoked the imagination of their fellow human beings. Those of us who have been known since antiquity as &#8216;monsters&#8217; and more recently as &#8216;freaks&#8217; defy the ordinary and mock the predictable, exciting both anxiety and speculation among our more banal brethren.&#8221; (Rosemarie Garland-Thomson, 1996, p. 1)</p>
                  
                  <p>In the above quotation, Rosemarie Garland-Thomson suggests that we have a &#8220;troubled fascination&#8221; with non-normal bodies, and that this fascination is a fundamental part of the stories we tell ourselves.</p>
                  
                  <p>In the next two steps we will look at the idea of the freak and the freak show, particularly during the 19th and early 20th centuries when the exhibiting of &#8220;monsters&#8221; in public places became popular. Who were these freaks? Why did people pay to see them? How did this role evolve over the 100 years when &#8220;freaks&#8221; performed?</p>
                  
                  <p>Particularly in 19th century North America, the freak show took on considerable popularity. People flocked to see famous freaks, first in taverns and performance halls, then in permanent exhibitions and museums, and later in circuses, fairgrounds and amusement parks. The most famous was P. T Barnum&#8217;s American Museum, in the 1840s, from which he developed spectacular circuses that ran right into the 20th century.</p>

                  <p>In a freak show the performers and/or their promoters intentionally construct visible difference or &#8220;abnormality&#8221; as entertainment. As Chemers (2005) points out, the freak show &#8220;nurtures discomfort&#8221; for profit. Freak show promoters or managers, like Barnum, actively produced difference through theatrical conventions. Even the naming or labelling of &#8220;freaks&#8221; directs audiences to embrace them as objects of spectacle and wonder. As you can see in the image above advertising a Barnum and Bailey show, &#8220;freaks&#8221; were not known for their names, but rather for their abnormality: Charles Tripp, The Armless Wonder; Mule Faced Woman; Prince Rambian, The Living Torso. These abnormalities were also bound up with ideas about race and gender. If you are interested in pursuing this link &#8212; which would be a great introduction to Week 5 &#8212; read Sarah Gold&#8217;s excellent paper on <a href=""http://escholarship.org/uc/item/39g057p3"">Millie-Christine McKoy and the American Freak Show</a>.</p>
                  
                  <p>Rosemarie Garland-Thomson (1996) argues that the rise and fall of the freak show in North America reflected a process of the American public coming to terms with a modern world. From the 1840s to 1900, North America experienced the rapid changes of industrialisation. One of the most intimate ways in which modernity affected people was at the level of the human body &#8212; machines replaced workers and factories standardised the ways in which we move through time and space. For these reasons, Garland-Thomson (1996) argues that the public of this period enjoyed the freak show as a way of thinking about the new and uncertain limits of their bodies. By the end of the 19th Century, though, modernity had taken hold &#8212; abnormal bodies needed to be uniform and standardised, or else they would be locked up in asylums or institutions. In these times, the &#8220;freak&#8221; became so stigmatised that Barnum changed the name of his shows to &#8220;human curiosities&#8221;.</p>
                  
                  <p>This change in the position of the &#8220;freak&#8221; in North American culture over a 50-year period shows us how the meaning of disability can really change over time. But what of the disabled performers themselves?</p>
                  
                  <p>Many assume that &#8220;freaks&#8221; were exploited. In his work, Robert Bogdan (1988) examines what &#8220;freaks&#8221; themselves thought about their positions in society. He complicates the idea that disabled performers were exploited by arguing that they were treated no better or worse than able-bodied performers at that time &#8212; apparently, the life of a performer was a hard one no matter what the circumstances. Bogdan (1988) began to think that &#8220;freaks&#8221; exploited the audience, by stylising their performances in uniquely theatrical ways for their own personal profits.</p>

                  <p>The activity in the last step briefly introduced the idea of the freak and helped us to think about both its negative and positive aspects. But in what ways is the idea of the freak still alive today?</p>
                  
                  <p>Does putting disabled people in the category of &#8220;freak&#8221; or &#8220;monster&#8221; still happen? Freak shows may have gone out of fashion and can be seen as distasteful by many people, but some disabled people are reclaiming the idea of the freak as a positive representation, placing it in the continuing tradition of the burlesque.</p>
                  
                  <p>Below is a link to an Australian news website. Follow the link (you might want to open it in a new tab) to see a video interview with Mat Fraser and Julia Atlas Muz. They are performers and artists who deliberately exploit the connection of freakishness with the disabled body, emphasising their own control over the process. As you watch the video, think about whether you agree with their arguments. Share your views with others in the comments for this step.</p>

                  <p>In the interview, Mat Fraser talks about how when he is stared at on the street, he feels he has no control or power over the staring, whereas on stage, he is able to control the staring encounter. Rosemarie Garland-Thomson has written much about the management of staring encounters by people with disabilities. In our interview with Rosemarie, she described the motivations for her 2009 book <em>Staring</em>:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><em>What I wanted to do [in the book] is bring forward something that isn&#8217;t done very often, and that is to think about how the people who are stared at because they have disabilities are actually the managers of these encounters. It&#8217;s often thought that staring is a form of rudeness, or it&#8217;s a form of appropriation, that it is somehow a kind of discriminatory act on the part of non-disabled people against people with disabilities, but I discovered and felt certainly from my own experience that it&#8217;s exactly the opposite. That the people who are stared at on the basis of disability have a lot of management strategies that they&#8217;ve developed. They really are in charge of these staring encounters. And they define themselves and they define disability through these exchanges, because they&#8217;re very accustomed to these exchanges, where often non-disabled people think they don&#8217;t spend any time with disabled people, they think perhaps they don&#8217;t know disabled people. But in fact, of course they interact with disabled people all the time.</em></p>
                  
                    <p><em>Staring makes everyone uncomfortable because it&#8217;s understood as an unacceptable form of interchange, and so the person who is staring often feels very uncomfortable about staring, and it&#8217;s the person with the disability who helps them along, and makes the social encounter smooth, and go well. And I wanted to bring that forward, the management strategies that people with disabilities learn to do as they travel through the world.</em></p>

"3.9","Fighting to belong: The Disabled People's Movement","Article","","","Week 3","2016-11-07","7 Nov","Week 3: Disability histories","https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/thinking-through-disability/2/steps/109664","[<div class=""a-text-context a-text-context--bold-intro"">
                  <p>The Disabled People&#8217;s Movement and the Disability Rights Movements are fundamental to thinking about the history and the present of disability.</p>
                  
                  <p>Disabled people have fought against social exclusion in an organised and politicised way for over fifty years. While there is no cohesive international history of the Disabled People&#8217;s movement, the slogan &#8220;Nothing about us without us&#8221; identifies the movement&#8217;s central concern. People with disabilities have equal rights to everyone else in society. As such, they have the right to choose to participate equally in all aspects of society and make decisions about their own lives.</p>
                  
                  <p>There is no one exact moment marking the beginning of the Disabled People&#8217;s Movement, but rather a range of social forces and events. As we&#8217;ve seen in earlier steps, institutionalisation, eugenics and the treatment of people with impairments in the holocaust were stark and horrifying examples of the differential ways in which people with impairments were treated. For those countries involved in World War I and World War II, the huge numbers of soldiers returning with impairments made the institutionalisation of all people with impairments impossible and the barriers in mainstream society more apparent.</p>
                  
                  <p>By the 1960s, social movements which galvanised support around marginalised groups, such as the feminist movement, the Gay and Lesbian movement and black civil rights, were creating significant change in the global North. The Disabled People&#8217;s Movement took its place alongside these movements to fight the marginalisation and stigmatisation of people with disabilities.</p>
                  
                  <p>This created some significant early changes. In North America, for example, the 1968 &#8220;Architectural Barriers Act&#8221; meant that any building that received federal funding had to be accessible to everyone. Following the mantra of &#8220;nothing about us without us,&#8221; legislative change through the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (and amendments in 1978), supported the Independent Living Movement in the US to create the opportunities for people with impairments to make decisions about their own lives.</p>
                  
                  <p>At the international level, 1981 saw the United Nations International Year of Disabled Persons. This helped draw attention  to disability as a public issue rather than a personal problem, with its focus on personal stories of disabled people&#8217;s experiences of discrimination. As a result, national governments in many countries responded with the introduction of rights based and anti-discrimination measures specifically addressing the experience of disabled people. For example, the Americans with Disability Act (1992) and the Disability Discrimination Act (1992, Australia; 1995, UK). This legislative focus on discrimination against people with disabilities addressed areas of inequality, such as:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <ul>
                      <li>employment</li>
                      <li>education</li>
                      <li>access to a building</li>
                      <li>goods and services</li>
                      <li>buying land</li>
                      <li>sport</li>
                      <li>government provisions</li>
                    </ul>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>Building on this more formalised national attention to issues of discrimination for disabled people in the 1980s, the Disabled People&#8217;s Movement set its sights on the achievement of rights for disabled people to  on a global scale. Sustained campaigns by activists across the world  culminated in the UN Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which entered into effect in 2007. While a significant achievement, the work of disabled people&#8217;s organisations is not yet done. A varied and vibrant movement of activists and organisations continues to work at local, national and international levels to make the rights of people with disabilities a reality.</p>

                  <p>In this step, we ask you to think about the considerable differences in accessibility in different places around the world.</p>
                  
                  <p>What is the situation where you live?

                  <p>For example, in India, people with disabilities still have their mobility severely restricted by the poor design of the built environment, 20 years after the Persons with Disability Act was passed in 1995.

                  <p>Paul Hunt (1937 &#8211; 1979) was a British disabled activist who has had a great influence on the direction of disability politics in the UK and elsewhere.</p>
                  
                  <p>He was central to the development of a social rather than medical model of disability, and initiated the setting up of the Union of the Physically Impaired Against Segregation (UPIAS) in the 1970s. This group went on to campaign against segregation of people with disabilities in asylums and other isolating institutions; and to criticise the ways in which &#8220;normal&#8221; societies create disabling barriers, such as in the design of the built environment.</p>
                  
                  <p>Paul Hunt&#8217;s important 1966 work, &#8220;A Critical Condition&#8221;, is available through the <a href=""http://disability-studies.leeds.ac.uk/library/"">University of Leeds Disability Archive</a>, which contains a large number of valuable historical documents from the UK disability movement. (If you want to know more about UPIAS for example, see <a href=""http://disability-studies.leeds.ac.uk/files/library/UPIAS-fundamental-principles.pdf"">Fundamental Principles of Disability</a> (1975), which clarified the concept of the social model).</p>

                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>Paul Hunt acknowledges the real effects of having an impairment, but sees disability as being centrally about relationships with &#8220;normal&#8221; people. Rather than viewing people with severe disabilities as less-than-human (unfortunate, useless, different, oppressed, sick), he says we should see them as human beings who can and want to live fulfilled and happy lives.</p>
                  
                  <p>What disabled people bring is a deep understanding of how society works in particular ways. From a disabled perspective some of the aspirational ideas about what makes a good life (wealth, possessions, having a job, being &#8220;normal&#8221;) are unimportant compared to the valuing of each human being for what they are; and the recognition that there are many different ways of making a contribution to the community.</p>
                  
                  <p>For Hunt this leads beyond the personal, to a demand for the right of everyone to be treated as fully human &#8212; that is, with respect and dignity. He argues that people with disabilities are in the &#8220;uncomfortable, subversive position&#8221; of always challenging those who do not address their own prejudices.</p>

                  <p>Disabled people have always been a part of human diversity. This week we have examined the contributions these people have made, how impairments have been noticed and the work disability has done throughout history.</p>
                  
                  <p>We started the week by thinking about how disability history leaves traces or hauntings on contemporary understandings and representations of disability today. Leanne&#8217;s lecture gave a summary of some key points and people in Western disability history, and we asked you to investigate some critical &#8220;moments&#8221; in history and examine how they shape our understanding of disability today.</p>
                  
                  <p>We hope that this historical knowledge helps you to reflect on the ideas from the last two weeks a little differently. For example, it might help you to trace how stereotypes and stigma about disability have persisted through time, and also how certain classifications have emerged through time.</p>
                  
                  <p>This overarching historical perspective will be very important as we launch into the materials in the coming weeks.</p>
                  
                  <p>In <strong>Week 4: Disability across the life course</strong>, we investigate the importance of disability across an individual&#8217;s life.</p>
                  
                  <p>In <strong>Week 5: The intersections of disability with other identities</strong>, we investigate the many different identities held by people with disabilities and explore how these identities interact.</p>
                  
                  <p>In <strong>Week 6: Towards a good life?</strong> we look at what philosophy has to say about disability and a good life, and ask how a good life can be enabled for all.</p>
                  
                  <p>As we will see in all these cases, understanding how an individual&#8217;s life story fits into a particular historical context is really important to understanding the diverse experiences of disability.</p>

                  <p>Let&#8217;s start to think about our own lives now. This could be a good step to do slowly. You might like to read the step now and then think about it for a day or so and come back to it.</p>
                  
                  <p>In this step we ask you to reflect on your own life. You could do this in a number of ways. Some of you might find it useful to draw a life line. This is a line along the page which represents your life &#8212; you could put ages along the line or leave it blank. Reflecting back on your life, begin putting significant events or moments on the line. If this doesn&#8217;t suit you, think about stories or photos which you would tell or show someone if you wanted to explain your life to them.</p>
                  
                  <p>If you&#8217;re having trouble thinking about this, the concept of &#8220;critical moments&#8221; described by British sociologist <a href=""http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/285568"">Rachel Thomson</a> and her team may be useful. In their study of young people transitioning to adulthood, Thomson and colleagues have tried to map these critical moments and have found that they often relate to family, illness or bereavement, moving, education, leisure, rites of passage and relationships. While Thomson and colleagues are looking at young people in particular, other research has found similar patterns.</p>
                  
                  <p>It might also help to think about:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <ul>
                      <li>event history (deaths, births, moves);</li>
                      <li>transitions (significant change in role or status);</li>
                      <li>turning points (when an event or transition significantly changed your life path).</li>
                    </ul>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <h3 id=""talking-points"">Talking points</h3>
                  
                  <p>Having reflected on the critical moments in your life, consider why it might be important to understand these moments if someone is to understand you. With this in mind:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Why do you think a life course perspective might be particularly useful to understanding experiences of disability?</li>

                  <p>As Iva described in the previous step, one of the ways the life course is often approached is by dividing it up into&#8221;&#8216;life phases&#8221; or stages.</p>
                  
                  <p>Some of you may have made similar divisions when you were thinking about your own life in <a href=""/courses/thinking-through-disability/2/steps/109689"">Step 4.2: Important moments in your life</a>. You might have noted distinct periods of childhood, adolescence, adulthood and old age. There were probably other things that stood out too &#8212; the death of a parent, the birth of a child, moving houses or cities, or changing schools or jobs. While life phases do sometimes coincide with different kinds of relationships, places, work, and responsibilities, they are not always clear or consistent. The boundaries around when we become an adult, for instance, are different depending on when and where we live. So too are the expectations around what it means to be an adult.</p>
                  
                  <p>That said, the ideas around what we should do in each stage of our lives can be persistent and strong, no matter what culture we live in. In the next steps we explore some of the ways disability has been experienced at different stages in people&#8217;s lives:</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Step 4.6 <a href=""/courses/thinking-through-disability/2/steps/109693"">Childhood</a></strong></p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Step 4.7 <a href=""/courses/thinking-through-disability/2/steps/109694"">Adolescence and emerging adulthood</a></strong></p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Step 4.8 <a href=""/courses/thinking-through-disability/2/steps/109695"">Adulthood</a></strong></p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Step 4.9 <a href=""/courses/thinking-through-disability/2/steps/109696"">Ageing</a></strong></p>
                  
                  <p>You can browse all these steps, or just focus on the ones that most interest you. If you like, you can move through all these different steps sequentially by clicking &#8216;Next&#8217; at the bottom of this page. Below are some questions to consider for each of the life stages:</p>

                  <p>In this video, we meet Lois, and she tells us a little bit about her life and her life history.

                  <p>In Week 3, we focussed on how people with disabilities have been treated in the past. This knowledge might help you put Lois&#8217;s life course in perspective. When Lois was born in 1955, it was common for people with impairments to be placed in institutions, such as the Stockton Hospital where she lived for 20 years. Lois&#8217;s transition out of this institution and into a group home is a reflection of a changing approach to disability and support. As we mentioned in <a href=""/courses/thinking-through-disability/2/steps/109688"">Step 4.1: Welcome to week 4</a>, it is useful to reflect on Elder&#8217;s work on the importance of situating a life course in a particular time and place.</p>
                  
                  <p>For most of us, ageing involves confronting new health challenges. Lois also confronts this and it creates significant changes in her life trajectory &#8212; she needs to move away from friends into a group home with more intensive supports.</p>

                  <p>As we saw in the first few weeks of the course, disability has been strongly associated with dependency, care and charity. This construction of people with impairments as requiring patronage and care from other adults has meant that people with disabilities have often been represented as &#8220;everlasting&#8221; children.</p>
                  
                  <p>While activism and advocacy have helped to change this perspective, many disability organisations and charities continue to use photographs of children with impairments in their advertising and promotion. While children are arguably cuter and more attractive to adult audiences, this positioning of children as the main image of people with disabilities potentially continues to infantilise people with disabilities and make adults with disabilities invisible.</p>

                  <p>As we have discussed throughout this week, while the idea of a &#8220;normal&#8221; life course is constructed, it is also a strong and persistent story.</p>
                  
                  <p>This step gives you a taste of reading academic writing. Mark Priestley&#8217;s academic paper &#8220;<a href=""http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/1654/"">Adults only: disability, social policy and the life course</a>&#8221; describes how ideas of the normal life course are constructed through the ways disability and other life phases are positioned in social policy. You can download a Green Open Access version of the paper on the landing page of the above link.</p>
                  
                  <p>Mark Priestley is a leading thinker on disability and the life course. In this piece he unpacks the relationships between disability, social policy and life course.</p>
                  
                  <p>Even though Priestley&#8217;s paper is focused on the United Kingdom and was published more than fifteen years ago, it has broad and enduring relevance. Priestley argues that one of the ways the &#8220;normal&#8221; life course is constructed is through how social policy and welfare regimes legislate and inscribe age and disability. In other words, he argues that social policy is deeply influenced by ideas about life course norms or rules.</p>
                  
                  <p>Priestley suggests that the historical construction of disability as a form of dependency &#8212; similar to that of children or the elderly &#8212; meant that people with disabilities were exempt from the workforce and therefore placed outside of the &#8220;normal&#8221; life phase of productive and reproductive adulthood. In the past, this meant that people with disabilities received state &#8220;supports&#8221; &#8212; sometimes in the form of institutionalisation, sometimes as a disability pension. But ruptures to the welfare state over the last 50 years have seen a significant change in the way the life course, disability and welfare are constructed.</p>
                  
                  <p>As we&#8217;ve seen in previous weeks, people with disabilities have fought the construction of themselves as dependent. Being excluded from the labour force due to an impairment is no longer considered acceptable; instead, people with disabilities have fought to be recognised as both productive and reproductive citizens. In some countries, this has fed into social policy in particularly neoliberal ways. Disability welfare and supports have been removed or reduced or more tightly classified.  Priestley begins to talk about this in the context of writing his paper. You might be able to reflect on this from your own contemporary context.</p>

                  <p>Let&#8217;s take a moment to reflect on the different stories and resources this week, and consider how useful you find the concept of life stages and the life course perspective.</p>
                  
                  <p>You might want to think too about how different cultural contexts may affect the relevance of the stages that in some societies we almost take for granted. Next week we will consider how disability can be thought about in relation to other ways in which we define ourselves &#8212; gender, sexuality, race, class etc.</p>
                  
                  <p>In the first weeks we showed how the very concept of disability is ambiguous and complicated and has changed through history. Here and next week we open up other ways of understanding disability, not as a fixed or static category in easy and common sense opposition to &#8220;able-bodied&#8221; or &#8220;able-minded&#8221;, but as dynamic, and always in interaction with people and environments.</p>

                  <p>The &#8220;privilege walk&#8221; activity was originally intended as a way to visually express how differential privilege affects our life chances. The exercise can very powerfully help identify factors that were in place before we began making our own choices in life, factors that reinforce and widen gaps in resources and access to opportunities.</p>
                  
                  <p>The rules are simple. Everyone gathers behind a long horizontal line. The facilitator reads different statements, such as &#8220;Your family owned the house where you grew up.&#8221; If the statement applied to you, you step forward; if it doesn&#8217;t, you step back. As the game progresses, the gaps between people get steadily larger. The activity also reveals the effects of intersectionality &#8211; some people may move both forwards and backwards, whilst others mainly find themselves heading in one direction.</p>
                  
                  <p>Understanding that everyone has multiple parts of their identities &#8212; that they are an intersection of many different categories &#8212; helps us to get a more complex picture of how privilege (and therefore, how disadvantage) works.</p>
                  
                  <p>For an example of a privilege walk in action, you can check out this Youtube video:</p>

                  <p>Now that we have considered the relationship between disability and poverty, let&#8217;s move on to other intersections with disability.</p>
                  
                  <p>Race and ethnicity are highly problematic ideas. When Louisa was talking about herself in the introduction to this week, her profile did not include her &#8220;race&#8221; as a white person.</p>
                  
                  <p>In a white dominated society like Australia, Louisa does not have to account for her &#8220;race, ethnicity or migration&#8221; status, because she is white and was born to a family that has been in Australia as white people for many generations.  Her racial status is not something she is made to think about in everyday life. This is not true of someone who &#8220;appears&#8221; to be of colour or is assumed to be a migrant.</p>
                  
                  <p>Socially shaped ideas about race, ethnicity and migration may actually generate disability, much like poverty. In fact, we know that people from non-dominant racial, ethnic and migratory groups are more likely to be poor across the globe because of the day-to-day and institutional forms of racial discrimination that they face. These connections are vital to understand when we are thinking about disability.</p>

                  <p>Like race, gender will affect how you experience disability.</p>
                  
                  <p>Gender is something we often take for granted. What are the first things that come to mind when you think of the word gender? Usually, when we as Educators ask this question, students will start to make lists of opposites: women and men; pink and blue; mother and father. This makes sense.</p>
                  
                  <p>The term gender has been taken from grammar. Some of you might speak a language where nouns are grouped into different categories of grammatical &#8220;gender&#8221;. For example, in German the word for flower, <em>Blume</em>, is feminine. Adopting the word &#8220;gender&#8221; from grammar shows how the term is an attempt to understand human bodies as divided into two types or kinds. As gender scholar Raewyn Connell puts it in her book <em>Gender</em>:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><em>Gender concerns the way human society deals with human bodies, and the many consequences of that &#8216;dealing&#8217; in our personal lives and our collective fates.</em></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>In other words, gender is not simply a natural or biological difference between two types or kinds of bodies. Instead, gender is learned. Famous feminist scholar Simone de Beauvoir said that &#8220;One is not born a woman, one becomes one.&#8221; In other words, one might be born biologically male or female, but one learns how to be &#8220;masculine&#8221; or &#8220;feminine&#8221; according to the standards of their culture and time.</p>
                  
                  <p>In the next step, we start to explore the intersection of disability and gender. We consider the ways non-disabled people think about gender in relation to people with disabilities and what this means in the lives of people with disabilities.</p>

                  <p>Olkin (2002) asks &#8216;When will disabled people be allowed to board the diversity train?&#8221; (as cited in Goodley, 2011, p.34).</p>
                  
                  <p>What Olkin is referring to here is the fact that while gender, race/ethnicity/migration, class and sexuality are often listed as forms of marginalisation and oppression in academic writing, disability is often excluded from this list. This is also the case in academic writing on intersectionality.</p>
                  
                  <p>In this step you have the opportunity to look at some of the academic writing which does examine disability in intersection with other identities or processes of marginalisation. In the reading list below, we provide links to some academic papers which use intersectional approaches.</p>
                  
                  <p>The Pisani and Grech (2012) paper on the intersection between disability and forced migration helps us think through disability differently. In examining the experiences and construction of disabled forced migrants from a number of perspectives, Pisani and Grech extend the way we think about ideas we have already discussed in the course &#8212; ideas around the normate, labelling, boundaries, citizenship, poverty and human rights.</p>
                  
                  <p>Their intersectional approach allows Pisani and Grech to point out the limits of contemporary disability studies, which has &#8220;failed to acknowledge issues of sovereignty, borders and bodies that are beyond the Nation State.&#8221; In this way, we see how intersectionality can help expand the boundaries of what we consider and the established patterns of how we think.</p>

                  <p>This week we&#8217;ve been broadening our understanding of how disablement works.</p>
                  
                  <p>In addition to disability, we&#8217;ve been investigating other social, cultural and economic identities or positions which can create disadvantage. Moreover, we&#8217;ve been encouraging you to think about how disability can be experienced very differently when it plays out in interaction with other  identities such as poverty, race, gender and sexuality.</p>
                  
                  <p>At the beginning of the week, we asked you to think about what categories make up your own identity &#8212; to think about yourself as intersectional. It might be interesting to reflect back on this now. Did you leave certain &#8220;invisible&#8221; categories out, like Louisa did when she &#8220;forgot&#8221; to include &#8220;white&#8221; and &#8220;middle-class&#8221;?  You might like to think about how these different aspects of your identity (particularly those &#8220;forgotten&#8221; ones) contribute to the privileges or disadvantages you experience.</p>
                  
                  <p>We focused on the poverty/disability cycle, as it so clearly feeds into and compounds disadvantage. We went on to introduce certain social categories &#8212; race, gender and sexuality &#8212; and then investigate how these categories interacted with disability in particular contexts.</p>
                  
                  <p>Much like last week, understanding disability in this nuanced way helps to understand it as a dynamic interaction. Disablement happens differently depending on other social, cultural and economic categories.</p>
                  
                  <p>Next week, the final week of the course, we will be returning to the overarching course theme of &#8220;a good life&#8221;. Intersectionality helps us think about a good life in a different way. It encourages us to think about the diversity of lives &#8212; that there is not one experience of impairment and no one experience of disablement. In this way, we are encouraged to think about the diversity of what it means to live a good life.</p>

                  <p>As Melissa Merritt discussed in the previous step, one of the central tenets of living a good life from the perspective of Western philosophy is that an individual has the capacity to make rational decisions which allows free choice around how to live their lives.</p>
                  
                  <p>Kelley Johnson and Jan Walmsley have been working together for several years to examine how notions of reason and rationality in Western philosophy can have powerful implications for disabled people today &#8212; particularly for people with learning disabilities who may not meet assumed &#8220;standards&#8221; of intellectual capacity.</p>
                  
                  <p>In writing a book on this issue, they decided not to just stick with the policy literature, or with work taking place within disability studies. Instead they turned to Western philosophy.</p>
                  
                  <p>Louisa interviewed Jan and Kelley about the approaches they have taken with their book. The transcript for the interview can be found in the downloads below.</p>
                  
                  <p>In the interview, Jan and Kelley talk about some challenges in our assumptions about what a good life is that have come out of a long tradition of Western thought.  They also argue that ideas of reason come mixed up with a belief in the importance of independence and autonomy. Again, people with intellectual disabilities, in particular, may not want a focus on independence, or may not be able to achieve it &#8212; that is, they may always have to rely on others for support.</p>
                  
                  <p>Jan makes the comment that independence and autonomy get linked to choice and control, and that all these Western ideas tend to incorporate a very individualistic idea of human beings. So who counts in Western society as being &#8220;fully human&#8221;? This is what we will look at next.</p>

"6.6","Who counts as ""worthy"" and who as ""worthless""?","Article","","","Week 6","2016-11-28","28 Nov","Week 6: Towards a good life?","https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/thinking-through-disability/2/steps/109723","[<div class=""a-text-context a-text-context--bold-intro"">
                  <p>Even briefly exploring Western philosophy shows us that there are inbuilt assumptions and beliefs about who counts as  &#8220;worthy&#8221; and who as &#8220;worthless&#8221; in society.</p>
                  
                  <p>As Melissa, Kelley and Jan have discussed in the previous steps, some of the assumptions in Western philosophy preclude people with disabilities from being human. These ideas have continued into contemporary times.</p>
                  
                  <p>Notably, twentieth century thinker Peter Singer (1993) placed reason at the core of what makes us human, and argued for the exclusion of many people with learning disabilities from the status of human being. And as you&#8217;ll recall from Week 3, theories of eugenics have followed through on these notions of human worth, resulting in  &#8220;cleansing&#8221; sections of the population deemed &#8220;unfit&#8221; &#8212; an issue that still echoes today with practices of genetic screening.</p>
                  
                  <p>The praise of reason in our Western understandings may lie at the core of the exclusion of people with learning or intellectual disabilities, who are defined by their &#8220;significant limitations in learning functioning&#8221; (according to a definition from the 2002 American Association of Mental Retardation). And the view that people with intellectual or learning disabilities have impaired reason may explain why policy-makers in the West have traditionally offered very limited &#8220;solutions&#8221;.</p>
                  
                  <p>These ideas and attitudes have implications for everyone with disabilities. For example, as we saw in Week 1, many people with disabilities are assumed to be child-like or stupid, whatever their intellectual capacities. Additionally, everyone in Western society is affected in some way by assumptions that reason, independence and individualism are the most important aspects of what makes us human.</p>
                  
                  <p>We will return to the importance of recognising all people with disabilities as fully human in our <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/working-with-disability"">Working with Disability</a> course, which starts from ideas of human rights and human diversity, and looks at the impacts of different policies on people with disabilities across the world.</p>

                  <p>In Andrew Solomon&#8217;s TED talk, he explores the impact of difference on people&#8217;s everyday lives.</p>
                  
                  <p>He starts from his own position as a gay man to engage with how various experiences of disability intersect with societal attitudes &#8212; resulting in a range of effects. He is particularly interested in how people form their identities within wider cultures.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""watch-the-video-on-tedcom"">Watch the video on ted.com</h3>

                    <p>Andrew Solomon: &#8220;<a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_solomon_love_no_matter_what?language=en"">Love, no matter what</a>&#8221;</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>Solomon suggests that the key factors in developing a flourishing life are across self-acceptance, family acceptance and social acceptance &#8212; but that these don&#8217;t necessarily coincide. He discusses several anecdotal cases to explore the importance of relationships, particularly between parents and children.</p>
                  
                  <p>He makes the point that some of our identities are handed down from one generation to another and are in his terms &#8220;vertical&#8221;, for example skin colour. These vertical identities/traits are accepted in society as unalterable.  However he sees others as &#8220;horizontal&#8221; identities and includes some forms of disability and gay identity among these. He argues that these horizontal identities require acceptance and love from family, and that, importantly, we discover and enrich these identities through our connections with peers.</p>
                  
                  <p>Solomon says that &#8220;people engage with the life they have and they don&#8217;t want to be cured or changed or eliminated. They want to be whoever it is that they&#8217;ve come to be.&#8221; Overall, he argues for the importance of love as a form of acceptance of difference.</p>

                  <p>In our second course, Working with Disability, we will continue to examine these strategies in more detail, reflecting further on inclusion, belonging, disability policy, peer-mentoring, advocacy and activism.</p>

                  <p>In this course, we have suggested that starting from disability may shift ideas of what makes a good life away from a focus on personal competency, material aspirations, and worldly pleasures &#8212; and towards concerns with diverse ways of making a contribution, and of the values of independence, inter-dependence, inclusion, community and belonging.</p>
                  
                  <p>As you continue to think through disability in your life, you will find that your ideas will continue to grow and evolve.</p>

                  <p>Thinking through a good life now, reflect on the following:</p>

                        <p>What do you include in (or exclude from) your understanding of a good life now that you didn&#8217;t before?</p>

                      <li>

                  <p>Now that the course has come to an end, we encourage you to reflect on what you have learned, both in this final week and as a whole. Thinking about your learning is not just about listing the things you&#8217;ve learned. It&#8217;s also about reflecting on yourself as a learner:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <ul>
                      <li>what and how you like to learn;</li>
                      <li>what you find difficult, uncomfortable or challenging;</li>
                      <li>what you are motivated to pursue independently;</li>
                      <li>and what goals you have for future learning.</li>
                    </ul>

                  <p>With the above in mind, share your reflections in the comments for this step. You can use the questions below as a guide, but they should by no means limit your discussion:</p>

                  <p>In Week 1, you took a survey to measure your attitudes and ideas about disability. <strong>We invite you to take this survey again</strong> now that you have completed the course, to see how your ideas may have changed. To take the survey, follow the link below.</p>
                  
                  <p>The survey is entirely optional. If you are participating in our research, your survey responses will be included in our research project. If not, you can still complete the survey to provide your feedback and see how your responses have changed, but your responses will not be included in our research.</p>
