                  <p>According to Associate Professor Vishaan Chakrabarti, hyperdensity is good urban design.</p>
                  
                  <p>Vishaan Chakrabarti is Founder of the Partnership for Architecture and Urbanism (PAU), a New York architecture and planning practice dedicated to the advancement of cities, and was previously a partner at SHoP Architects. He is also an Associate Professor of Practice at Columbia University. Chakrabarti argues that hyperdensity, defined as density sufficient to support intensive public transportation systems - typically regarded as 30 dwelling units per acre or 75 units per hectare, contributes to health, prosperity and sustainability of cities.</p>

                  <sub>Hyperdensity: 30 dwelling units per acre / 75 units per hectare</sub></p>
                  
                  <p>Density is a measure of the number of dwellings or population size in a given land area. It is often discussed and visualised in terms of the building height/number of storeys in relation to the amount of open space, as shown in the <a href=""https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/files/8e/ed/8eedfd67-9166-48a2-809c-c97afcdf4685/visualisingdensity.pdf"">visualising density infographic</a>. This can also be seen in seen in the <a href=""http://www.ecodencity.com.au/density-simulator/"">Urban Taskforce Australia&#8217;s Density Simulator</a>.</p>
                  
                  <p>Chakrabarti has written a book called &#8216;Country of Cities: A Manifesto for an Urban America&#8217; and an article titled <a href=""https://placesjournal.org/article/building-hyperdensity-and-civic-delight/"">Building Hyperdensity and Civic Delight</a>. He also gave a public lecture at UNSW Australia on this topic, which we have formatted into 3 episodes, as videos on YouTube. These are provided as additional resources to further explain the importance of density and how it can be positive for cities in terms of beauty, joy, public health, economy and the environment.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>1. <a href=""https://youtu.be/BpuRJwkwsO4"">Introduction</a> (6:17)</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>Vishaan Chakrabarti introduces the concept of hyperdensity, linking density to sustainability, and discussing why cities are better in reducing the carbon footprint per capita.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>2. <a href=""https://youtu.be/kXukRMSO26M"">Hyperdensity in context</a> (12:47)</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>With the premise that cities are fundamentally better based on the metrics of the environment, economy, public health and joy, Vishaan Chakrabarti discusses how to build better cities.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>3. <a href=""https://youtu.be/MA4H2lS67pE"">Hyperdensity design by SHoP Architects</a> (6:15)</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>Vishaan Chakrabarti discusses hyperdense architecture by SHoP Architects, including the Barclay&#8217;s Arena, Gotham Gateway, Essex Crossing Masterplan, and Domino Sugar Refinery Masterplan.</p>

                    <p><strong>Talking Points</strong></p>
                  
                    <p>The hyperdensity model proposed by Chakrabati suggests &#8220;leaving nature natural&#8221;, with cities having concentrated infrastructure and shared resources. Do you think it is feasible or even possible to leave nature natural? Do you see hyperdensity as something that could be applied to your context?

                  <h3 id=""trigeneration"">Trigeneration</h3>
                  <p>Trigeneration is referred to as combined cooling, heat and power (CCHP). This process simultaneously generates electricity, heating and cooling for usable consumption from the combustion of a fuel (typically natural gas) or a solar heat collector. Trigeneration is an improvement of cogeneration systems that generate electricity and heating.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""triple-bottom-line-tbl"">Triple bottom line (TBL)</h3>
                  <p>The triple bottom line (TBL) is an accounting framework that incorporates three dimensions of performance: social, environmental and financial. This differs from traditional reporting frameworks as it includes ecological (or environmental) and social measures that can be difficult to assign appropriate means of measurement. The TBL dimensions are also commonly called the three Ps: people, planet and profits.</p>

                  <p>Settlements are usually designated as urban once they have grown large enough to support industries which are not rural in nature. No common figure can be put on the size of an urban area as settlements function differently in different areas due to local circumstances.</p>
                  
                  <p>However, in Australia, census districts which have a population density of 200 or more persons per square kilometre are classified as urban.</p>

                  <p>We were very pleased to see so many of you enjoying the first week of Re-Enchanting the City with us and with your fellow learners.</p>
                  
                  <p>This was an amazing first week, with over 2,700 people signing up to take the course; and we are very grateful for the extremely positive response to the course so far. It has been wonderful getting to know you, where you are from, and the work you do. We are delighted to see how many people across the world have taken the opportunity to engage with the discussion forums. We are also blown away by the richness in the discussions and it is great to see you engaging with each other&#8217;s comments. Please keep this up. If you have not already done so, please introduce yourself to your fellow learners <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/re-enchanting-the-city/2/steps/96835"">step 1.2</a> and locate your city in our&#160;<a href=""https://www.zeemaps.com/map?group=2097074"">interactive map</a>.</p>
                  
                  <p>Thank you for all the amazing and inspiring examples from your cities, which are your realities. These examples covered street art, installations, interactive public furniture, interactive public places, parks, buildings, and nature. These somehow reminded me of the words of Dr Laura Lee who said: &#8220;Art questions reality, Science describes reality, and Design shapes and changes reality&#8221;. The hyperdensity discussion has also been very vibrant and has been getting numerous comments of a very deep level.</p>
                  
                  <p>Thank you also for participating in the <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/re-enchanting-the-city/2/steps/96839"">Poll question</a>, &#8216;What contributes to enchantment?&#8217; The results show parks / squares /public open spaces as the top choice (55%). See the full <a href=""https://futurelearn.typeform.com/report/a5jtsm/EOu2"">results here</a>. In the discussion around the poll, many of you mentioned surprise/mystery, greenery and history as important aspects of enchantment.</p>

                  <p>There has been much sharing on the <strong><a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/aovu7x4ttcly"">Padlet wall</a></strong> of many enchanting places from your local areas across the globe.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Nicole</strong> from Sydney provided a concise summary of all your contributions stating &#8220;the ideal city would have&#160;robust social services infrastructure (health system, education, water supply, power supply, waste treatment, etc.).&#8220; She also provided a list of 21 other items that add to livability and enchantment.</p>
                  
                  <p>The most liked and discussed topic was that of the benefits of Pok&#233;mon Go, raised by <strong>Leslie</strong> from the US who is currently in Muscat, Oman.</p>
                  
                  <p>On the topic of games again, <strong>Julian</strong> shared a great example of <a href=""https://vimeo.com/113918378"">interactive traffic light (StreetPong)</a> that allows one to play with a complete stranger across the road, making the wait at the traffic light entertaining.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Seamus</strong> from Sydney identified the <a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/aovu7x4ttcly/wish/121598345"">High Line in New York</a>, well-liked by others.

                  <p><strong>Moly</strong> from the UK shared the <a href=""https://www.gardenbridge.london/about-the-project"">Garden Bridge project</a> as an example of sustainable urban design.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Muaz</strong> from Qatar shared multiple examples, one a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqLX-Z88LnE"">3D art on pavements</a>, and another - <a href=""http://candychang.com/work/before-i-die-in-nola/"">&#8220;Before I Die&#8221; chalkboards</a> where people take a minute to stop and think about deeper aspects of their lives.</p>

                  <p><strong>Belinda</strong> from Sydney and <strong>Raman</strong> shared examples of padlocks attached by people onto fences in public places that are later removed by councils.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""hyperdensity-and-its-applicability-to-you"">Hyperdensity and its Applicability to You</h3>
                  
                  <p>There was much discussion over Vishaan Chakrabarti&#8217;s talk in <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/re-enchanting-the-city/2/steps/96841"">step 1.9</a>. Generally, participants agreed with Chakrabarti around the need for hyperdensity, though opinions were divided over the feasibility of leaving nature natural. Questions people have include - what is natural, and have we already had too much impact on nature to speak about leaving it natural, will retrofitting hyperdensity negatively affect existing vernacular aesthetics?</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Raymond</strong> from Australia agreed with Chakrabati&#8217;s argument for hyperdensity but questioned how to change the political and cultural expectations of people.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Tobias</strong> from Sydney stated that &#8220;leave nature as natural is the wrong starting point - I think we need to look at how we value natural environments.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p>Affordability was also raised as well as gentrification where well-resourced, well-connected, sustainable apartments tend to be expensive.</p>
                  
                  <p>The importance of usable infrastructure to support hyperdensity (e.g. safe cycle paths, footpaths, pleasant public transport experiences as opposed to car-centred transport) was also noted by many. If dwellings aren&#8217;t fit for purpose, there may be increased transience</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Pablo</strong> from Spain challenged the view that &#8220;In a democracy you can&#8217;t command people to leave green, urban, dense lives&#8221;, sharing examples of how places around the world are doing the opposite:<br/>

                  <p>In <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/re-enchanting-the-city/2/todo/6322"">Week 2</a>, Fight for the Site, we look at the story of Central Park, the development processes behind the making of it, and the significance of this $2 billion development within the urban fabric of Sydney. It skims over the site&#8217;s early history to consider in more detail the narrative of site-planning politics from 2003, when the land first came up for sale, to 2007, when the first concept plan was approved. This will include purchases, sackings, market collapses, changes of government, local controversy, design competitions, committees, master plans and litigation.</p>
                  
                  <p>Now, on to Week 2! The course team is looking forward to reading your discussions for week 2&#8217;s videos and activities.</p>

                  <p>Thank you for all the contributions through this week, valuable links provided and debate over important issues relating to Central Park and other developments around the world.</p>
                  
                  <p>We started the week with vibrant discussion on health and community. Many highlighted essential characteristics of a healthy city such as facilities that allow for a healthy lifestyle of walkability and being active. Dr Pinnegar&#8217;s video sparked discussion on what was not mentioned, that of the political influence/interference. Dr Sunindijo&#8217;s succinct explanation of the construction profession received very positive feedback. Professor Tzannes and Professor Weirick gave historical context to Central Park and the design of the masterplan. Dr Farrelly&#8217;s narrative of the old brewery site&#8217;s dramatic redevelopment plans addressed the political issues. You heard from a range of stakeholders including local government (Lord Mayor Clover Moore), community (Jeanette Brokman), the state representation (Chris Johnson as former Government Architect and Director of the State Department of Planning) and Central Park&#8217;s developer (Dr Stanley Quek). Participants deeply considered the fight of Central Park and evaluated the influences of sites being state or nationally significant, with scale and broader impact being a key area discussed</p>

                  <p>A healthy city is a green city! It is also a safe city &#8211; people have to perceive the environment to be safe, otherwise, they will not venture out.</p>

Of particular interest is this article about green space in cities for both human health and environmental health: <a href=""http://www.hphpcentral.com/article/urban-planning-and-the-importance-of-green-space-in-cities-to-human-and-environmental-health"">Urban planning and the importance of green space in cities to human and environmental health</a></p>
                  
                  <p>The City of Sydney &#8216;CityTalks&#8217; recently did a great session on green space with the New York Commissioner for Parks and a Sydney based panel which included myself.  A lot of complex issues were discussed, including the balance between development and provision of much needed open space and how this is politically charged and difficult!  You can listen and watch the <a href=""http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/council/news-and-updates/global-issues-ideas-and-conversations/city-talks-design/planning-parks-with-the-wellbeing-of-people-first?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=CityTalks%20Design%20Wed%2017%20May&amp;utm_content=CityTalks%20Design%20Wed%2017%20May+CID_e99c234ab950e08cfa8e76cc45955388&amp;utm_source=Email%20marketing&amp;utm_term=Watch%20now"">event here</a></p>
                  
                  <p>A recent study of community gardens and their importance was undertaken by the NSW Environment Trust: <a href=""http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/grants/150803-Community-Food-Initiatives.pdf"">Community Food Initiatives Research Report</a></p>
                  
                  <p>And some videos on community gardens and food for urban populations:<br/>

                  <p>And there is work that we did at UNSW a while back on community gardens in low income housing estates with a very culturally diverse community:

                  <h4 id=""planning-challenges"">Planning Challenges</h4>
                  <p>Community consultation is a very important issue and given the political nature of planning, genuine community consultation is not always occurring. See <a href=""http://bangthetable.com/"">Bang the Table</a></p>
                  
                  <p>Politically it can be very important and strategic to argue that action for health will bring about additional (at no extra cost) positive improvements to sustainability and other related issues such as productivity (called co-benefits).  This is about efficiencies for governments in policies and actions. In the UK there is a great resource which pulls this together: <a href=""http://healthsustainabilityplanning.co.uk/"">Health and Sustainable Planning Online Resource</a></p>
                  
                  <h4 id=""affordability"">Affordability</h4>
                  
                  <p>The issue of housing affordability is currently dominating the discourse on housing. The City Futures Research Centre at UNSW has done a lot of research in this area. Have a look at the <a href=""http://blogs.unsw.edu.au/cityfutures/blog/category/affordable-housing/"">Centre&#8217;s blog</a> for articles on housing affordability (and lots more!).</p>
                  
                  <p>There is also the <a href=""http://www.ahuri.edu.au/"">Australian Institute of Housing Research (AHURI)</a>.</p>
                  
                  <p>And <a href=""https://theconversation.com/au"">The Conversation</a> which has published a lot of easy to read articles on this topic. Do a <a href=""https://theconversation.com/search?q=housing+affordability"">search for articles on housing affordability</a> and you will find lots of myth-busting information, including infographics.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""healthy-cities-discussion"">Healthy Cities Discussion</h3>
                  
                  <p>Walkability was mentioned by many including <strong>Jonathan</strong> from Sydney, <strong>Jose</strong> from Caracas, <strong>Nikki</strong> and <strong>Natalie</strong>.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Eleftheria</strong> argues &#8220;a healthy city is a place that you can live there with less stress, less time to go to your job, more green parks, more activities for kids and their parents.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p>The distribution and quality of green spaces, including playgrounds, sport and exercise facilities was identified by many as improving mental and physical health, as well as helping people connect to each other. People discussed the need for walkability (including feelings of safety), cycle infrastructure and good, affordable public transport to promote efficient systems and associated health benefits. Recycling and waste infrastructure were also identified as important to keep the city clean.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Natalie</strong> from Singapore notes the importance of inclusive environments, &#8220;place where people of all ages, incomes and abilities feel welcome and supported.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Lesogo</strong> from Mozambique/Botswana points out that &#8220;may not have the budget for a robust exercise and keeping up with the times and making sure that cities are resilient, sustainable, healthy and liveable now and in the future.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Mandy</strong> from Boston argues for &#8220;cohesively engaging natural elements into the cityscape. Creating enchantment in a way that sparks curiosity enough to explore things further engaging the mind and body.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Michael</strong> from Brisbane notes, &#8220;Trees and nature calm my mind, great architecture inspires me and when it is matched with facilities conducive to physical activity I am at my healthiest and content.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p>Michael raises an important point about the impact on nature on our well-being, an area that will be discussed further in week 4.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Ian</strong> from Newcastle-under-Lyme, UK, notes that &#8220;every city is a prisoner of its past&#8221;, and it&#8217;s &#8220;very difficult, sometimes impossible, to alter the historic patterns of the city to accommodate new ways of living without enormous consequences.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Alison</strong> from Paris agrees, citing the example of Rome, where finding ancient sites can disrupt infrastructure projects, while Timothy from Manchester argues that &#8220;As active transport benefits cannot always be measured in a commercial sense, in the same way hard infrastructure can in terms of ticket sales, it sometimes discounted because it viewed as a financial loss&#8221;, but lateral thinking can sometimes create useful solutions.)</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""state-significance-discussion"">State Significance Discussion</h3>
                  
                  <p>There was much discussion and quite a diversity of reasons what constitutes significance.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Leon</strong> gave 3 reasons &#8211; &#8220;size/placement of the development (i.e. a gateway site, or harbour front or alike), if there is any particular historical significance (i.e. the brewery site) to the site and finally if the intended use of the site is going to benefit and large proportion of the population (for instance a project like federation square in Melbourne).&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Tangumonkem</strong> speaks about controversial development in Yaounde, Cameroon.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Cristina</strong> from Milan believes &#8220;The key is sustanaibility.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Ian</strong> from Newcastle-under-Lyme, UK, raises the political problem where parties will become more entrenched in their opinion and less likely to compromise, and suggested &#8220;If, at a local level, the matter cannot be resolved, a higher authority needs to make the decision &#8220;.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""other-contributions"">Other Contributions</h3>
                  
                  <p><strong>Fabian</strong> from Cali-Co stated &#8220;When I was studying architecture, teachers always said: Think in the urban context. And they were not talking just about the buildings and urban spaces that surrounded the project.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Dr Riza Yosia Sunindijo</strong> joined the discussion and spoke to project management including &#8220;developing trust and mutual goals is important to minimise conflicts.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Muaz</strong> from Qatar builds upon Professor Alec Tzannes comment about Social, Economic, Financial Forces are always changing cities. &#8221;I would like to add Environmental challenges drive change as well.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Raymond</strong> states &#8220;Numerous studies have shown that people who are happy and satisfied with their work/life balance are much more productive in their employment. Brilliant urban design goes a long way to achieving this.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Marile</strong> from Cape Town suggests that to create promote social interaction and economic upliftment, &#8220;everyone needs to come to the table to create the best urban environment. Politicians / government officials should not be too regulatory, the developer should not just think about his own pocket and the community should play ball as well.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Nicole</strong> from Sydney provided a &#8220;fun short video Re: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chl5_z-gkWg"">The 6 professionals in the construction value chain</a>.&#8221;</p>

                  <p>In <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/re-enchanting-the-city/2/todo/6323"">Week 3</a>, Architecture in the City, we explore the role of architecture and architects in city making. It covers urban design and iconic design, as well as celebrity architects (Starchitects) and their role in sites like Central Park. The site embodies an unusually high concentration of international design talent. Questions explored are: &#8220;What is urban design&#8221;?, &#8220;What is its role in city-making, and in the re-enchantment agenda&#8221;? and &#8220;What are the dynamics startchitects bring to an urban development?&#8221;.</p>

                  <p>Iconic buildings are a symbol of a city; a statement about its history, ambition or how it wants to be seen.</p>
                  
                  <p>Iconic buildings can be simple structures like the Vancouver Special, which is a particular Vancouver housing style which began in the 1960s. Or these buildings can be grand like the Nouvel&#8217;s Torre Agbar, Barcelona and other buildings as shown.

Find an image or take a photograph of the building and post it on the <a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/128svikn5uqw"">Padlet wall</a>, and come back to this step to discuss (in the Comments area) the aspects that you believe make it a signature building (up to 150 words).</p>
                  
                    <p>Include the location of the building and architect (if known). If the architect is known, is he/she a starchitect (famous architect)? Consider if the architect was already famous and perhaps hired to design an iconic building or whether the design made him/her famous.</p>
                  
                    <p>Remember to include the Padlet URL in your text discussion.</p>

                  <h3 id=""reflection-from-dr-paola-favaro"">Reflection from Dr Paola Favaro</h3>
                  
                  <p>I read most of the comments from the learners and enjoyed very much the lively discussions and the diversity of approaches from so many people around the world.</p>
                  
                  <p>This week there were excellent discussions on heritage architecture and sensitivity; architecture/urban design; diversity and regulations; and iconic architecture.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id=""heritage-architecture"">Heritage Architecture</h4>
                  
                  <p>For me, in Sydney, there are a number of interesting projects which combine a respectful design approach to heritage buildings and their adaptive reuse where &#8216;old and new&#8217; complement each other.</p>
                  
                  <p>Romaldo Giurgola&#8217;s New Parramatta Cathedral; Tonkin, Zulaika, Greer&#8217;s adaptive reuse of the Old Custom House at Circular Quay and Richard Francis-Jones&#8217; (and FJMT) adaptation of The Mint in Macquarie Street are great examples.
                  Opened in 2004, The Mint is a demonstration of how a new project can connect and add a new chapter to the continuity of history. Architecture can transform a heritage place into a contemporary place &#8220;through a respectful attitude to both conservation and renewal&#8221;. See Philip Thalis introduction to Robert Griffin (ed.) <em>The Mint Project</em>, published by the Historic Houses Trust of NSW (2009).</p>
                  
                  <p>Foster + Partners&#8217; new addition to the Reichstag in Berlin as the new German Parliament is another examples of how architects can achieve a successful integration of old and new. The heritage buildings keep their historical integrity and visibility through a sensitive respect for the existing volumes, the conservation of the original materials and the restoration of the most important original interior spaces. While the visibility of the new volumes and geometries, like in the glazed cupola of Foster + Partners in Berlin, and interior spaces are all created through a sophisticated design using new materials and contemporary technologies with the aim of enhancing the original fabric. The result is a balanced visible composition of old and new volumes, materials and usable spaces.</p>
                  
                  <p>Heritage consciousness in Sydney was established in 1971 with the City of Sydney Strategic Plan. Addressing heritage considerations is now an integral component of the development approval process which revolves around a contextual philosophy of &#8216;design excellence&#8217;. See: <br/>

                  <h4 id=""diversity-and-regulations"">Diversity and Regulations</h4>
                  
                  <p>As part of very lively discussion on diversity and regulations, we might reflect on the historical development of urban planning. For example, how the strict functional separation of zones (zoning) and its negative consequence of residential &#8216;dormitories&#8217; without collective commercial and cultural activities has been replaced by the diversity of building types, activities and social characteristics (mix-use).</p>
                  
                  <p>An interesting comment by <strong>Sophia</strong> from Athens:<br/>
                  &#8220;To me architectural diversity reflects human diversity. If we suppose that an urban environment (a city, neighbourhood) is the outcome of either an historical era, or the result of an organised plan, then we can very easily prove that what forms a city is a complex sum of rules, regulations, inspiration, imagination. It seems to me that regulations in urban design must only exist to alleviate and serve for a better picture. Let&#8217;s use the regulations and not let them determine the final picture.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p>On reflection, and to continue Sophia&#8217;s comment, it might be useful reading a recent publication by Graeme Davison: <em>City Dreamers: The Urban Imagination in Australia</em>. Davison suggests that he became an urban historian because &#8220;he believed that our cities deserved more of our curiosity and idealism.&#8221; As the tile of this course <em>Re-enchanting the City</em>, Davison talks about the urban history of Australian cities by focusing on &#8220;dreamers&#8221;, &#8220;those who battle to make and re-make our cities.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <h4 id=""iconic-architecture-or-iconic-urban-precinct"">Iconic Architecture? or Iconic Urban Precinct?</h4>
                  
                  <p>I enjoyed very much the approach to the discussion by <strong>Kooi-ying</strong> who very sensitively mentions the ICONIC Castlecrag Precinct in North Sydney and its <a href=""http://www.willoughbydhs.org.au/History/Suburbs/Suburbs-Castlecrag.html"">15 ICONIC Houses</a> designed in the 1920s by Walter Burley Griffin and his wife Marion Mahoney-Griffin.</p>
                  
                  <p>We can reflect here on the world ICONIC and how developers might realise that ICONIC means more than realising an &#8216;original&#8217; building with an &#8216;original&#8217; form and material on a site. The ICONIC building has to be part of the overall context. If the masterplan works well, the ICONIC building(s) adds with its unique program and well thought architecture and urban spaces quality to the overall urban precinct and the city.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""diversity-discussion"">Diversity Discussion</h3>
                  
                  <p>The general consensus was to have a fine balance of regulations vs creative freedom in order to maintain cohesiveness in urban design and planning, and yet respect the vast diversity of society.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Kooi-ying</strong> suggested &#8220;successful outcome of any urban design very much depend on their design principles, participation of various stakeholders including the local government and the inclusion of different social agendas, the creative implementation of the regulatory controls, the layering of history and heritage.&#8221; Two links were provided:<br/>

                  <p><strong>Biljana</strong> from Montenegro reminded us that &#8220;one city is not homogeneous social structure, no matter how similar its inhabitants may be.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Nikki</strong> suggested &#8220;Sydney architecture is designed from the point of regulations - what are the height controls, setbacks, articulation, GFA and character that are permitted. The result is a curtailment of creativity.&#8220;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Athalia</strong> stated &#8220;paying extra attention towards the transition area so as to not give a blunt difference between the old and the new.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""heritage-discussion"">Heritage Discussion</h3>
                  
                  <p>There was lively discussion on the appreciation of heritage architecture, and the meaningful retention of heritage buildings. It was noted that many European cities were successful in retaining their romantic character due to their long histories and old buildings, while Australia only has a 200 year history in terms of urban design and architecture. The lack of appreciation of old buildings was mentioned by participants in different parts of the world where old buildings are pulled down as the state does not strive to conserve.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Natalie</strong> initiated debate on the value of the Australian Hotel. She &#8220;admire the intent of creating a datum line to separate the new from the old, the design is quite cumbersome with the new structure appearing to hover awkwardly above the existing building.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Raymond</strong> suggested &#8220;Foster and Partners almost got it right, in my opinion the incorporation of the art deco feature of rounded corners on the new structure works exceptionally well. Where it fails is the colour scheme; the silver/grey bands contrast too starkly with the soft browns of the heritage building, the result is an unnatural architectural form that has an awkward look of an unbalanced competition between the old and the new.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Mark</strong> argued &#8220;The heritage significance of the hotel is not diminished, but enhanced by contrast to the other architecture at the site.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p>There was much support for the approach of &#8216;adaptive re-use&#8217; as an important element of preserving heritage architecture.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Terry</strong> from the UK captured the thoughts of many others &#8220;As a city dweller I applaud and treasure schemes that sympathetically and appropriately repurpose old buildings even though only the fa&#231;ades remain. Such developments enhance and preserve the identity of neighbourhoods and can be a playful juxtaposition amongst more &#8216;serious&#8217; constructions.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Jacob</strong> from Sydney reinforced the point of visibility of the Brewery building sharing 2 links of the architecture lit up during Vivid.<br/>

                  <h3 id=""nature-on-architecture-and-one-central-park-discussion"">Nature on Architecture and One Central Park Discussion</h3>
                  
                  <p>Many appreciated the evaluation of imitation vs presentation of nature on buildings using a historical perspective. The question raised was why does it need to be one or the other, could it not be a mix of both? The answer provided was based more on ideology. Dr Peter Kohane identified classical theory based on Vitruvian ideas of composition. The modernists moved away from tradition and ornament with focus on technology and minimalist design. Post-modernists returned to ornament, symbolism and metaphor.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Eva</strong> noted &#8220;thanks to the technology we can evolve from the past. We mustn&#8217;t forget architecture history but we must take advantage of our time. That means new ways of understanding ornaments and rooftops, now it could be as something dynamic which changes with the time.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p>Many noted a preference for the term &#8216;enabling&#8217; architects rather than &#8216;collaborating&#8217; as enabling signified the concept of the original design come into being and making it a reality from its concept stage. In general the architect&#8217;s (PTW) role in bringing into fruition Jean Nouvel&#8217;s design, generated many positive comments.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Peter</strong> from Sydney was impressed by &#8220;the post tensioned slabs and how the planter boxes (soil, water, plants etc.) compensate by weight at the edges. This means they must be in place for the life of the building. That&#8217;s a big commitment.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""iconic-architecture-and-starchitects-discussion"">Iconic Architecture and Starchitects Discussion</h3>
                  
                  <p>The discussion of what makes a building iconic also generated much interest, with Terry from the UK suggesting it was a sense of historical significance that outlived the actual structure. He gave the example of the Palm House at the Royal Botanical Gardens (London) in Kew.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Fabian</strong> from Cali, Colombia noted that a sarchitect will design a project which generates publicity for the site or country, &#8220;Guggenheim Museum of Bilbao, designed by Frank Gehry, is a good example. This city of Spain went from a little-known port to a world famous city thanks in part to the bold and controversial building of Gehry.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p>Many examples were put forward from Sydney - Sydney Opera House, Bondi Icebergs, Dr. Chau Chak Building (by Gehry), Auroro Place, Australia Square, Sirius building, Castlecrag houses. Other Australian examples included Q1 building (Surfers Paradise), Federation Square (Melbourne), Melbourne Terrace, (and Newcastle City Administration Centre were a few of the Australian examples.</p>
                  
                  <p>One of the most liked iconic building was the <a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/128svikn5uqw/wish/124985158"">Marina Bay Sands, Singapore</a>, posted by <strong>Natalie</strong>.</p>
                  
                  <p>Also highly liked &#8211; <strong>Vineta&#8217;s</strong> post of <a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/128svikn5uqw/wish/124517525"">National Library of Latvia in Riga</a>.</p>
                  
                  <p><a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/128svikn5uqw/wish/126188364"">Biblioteca Virgilio Barco in Bogota</a> was noted as an example by <strong>Vladimir</strong> from Bogota who said that inspired him to become a designer architect.</p>
                  
                  <p><a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/128svikn5uqw/wish/126128507"">Grand Central Station</a> was noted by <strong>Rachel</strong> as an iconic building in Manhatten &#8220;due to its history, starting as a steam train terminus it quickly changed into an electric train station and has many outstanding features, the staircases, the reference to the acorns - symbols of the family who financed the build and the transformation to electric and all that this involved.&#8221; She noted the significance of its benefactors &#8216;the Vanderbilts&#8217; who were equally responsible for its architectural significance, just as the architect John Snook.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Leslie</strong> noted &#8220;There is no shortage of iconic buildings in the <a href=""https://www.thebig5hub.com/galleries/top-10-iconic-buildings-in-the-middle-east/"">Arabian Gulf</a>. Dubai especially is continuously trying to outdo itself.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""whats-next"">What&#8217;s Next?</h3>
                  
                  <p>In <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/re-enchanting-the-city/2/todo/6324"">Week 4</a>, Being Green, we focus on this 5 Green-star development&#8217;s most significant sustainability initiatives, on sustainable urbanism and the inclusion of nature into the city. It examines design innovations in green technologies, and environmental building services. The examples discussed are the living green walls (inspiring/green seduction); the trigeneration system (energy use); and water recycling (rainwater collection and reuse of waste). Some of the questions considered are:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>What are the main considerations and strategies for sustainability?</li>
                    <li>How does landscape architecture contribute to living green?</li>
                    <li>Why it is important to renature the city?</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>We hope discussions of the themes raised this week will expand and develop further in week 4.</p>

                    <p><strong>Talking Points</strong></p>
                  
                    <p>The big difficulty with the triple bottom line, encompassing economic, social and environmental aspects of human activity, is that we can only really measure how well we&#8217;re doing with one of these. This is the economic activities, for which we use financial measures - dollars and cents.</p>
                  
                    <p>Some new rating systems, such as LEED ratings or Green Building Council&#8217;s Green Star system, are applied with buildings or sites being developed, but rarely are they monitored for the long term, systematically to provide metrics for the environmental impacts.</p>
                  
                    <p>Social impacts might be measured in multiple ways, such as through physical and mental health indicators, or numbers of people using public transport and walking/cycling more, but these individual measures are difficult to consolidate. The concept of a &#8216;triple bottom line&#8217; should try to capture more than just the financial or economic results, but also the social and environmental impacts of human activity as well but it&#8217;s tricky!</p>
                  
                    <p>In your view, what are measures or metrics might we use to assess positive environmental impacts and/or positive social impacts? What can we measure to know we&#8217;re improving things? (Up to 150 words.)</p>

                  <h3 id=""reflection-from-associate-professor-linda-corkery"">Reflection from Associate Professor Linda Corkery</h3>
                  
                  <p>Many thanks to everyone for your thoughtful and considered comments in response to the ideas presented during Week 4, &#8220;Being Green&#8221;. You&#8217;ve raised some very interesting issues and made insightful and relevant points.</p>
                  
                  <p>By this time in the course, it should be clear that many different approaches will be required to implement &#8220;green&#8221; planning, designing, and building for cities of the future. In anticipation of more people and changing climates, all built environment professionals - landscape architects, architects, planners, urban designers, builders and developers - must collaborate to find innovative solutions that will meet these challenges. No doubt, you&#8217;re beginning to understand that the issues are complex. No one profession has the full scope of understanding or all the knowledge and expertise needed to address them.</p>
                  
                  <p>This week we&#8217;ve looked at how the Central Park development explicitly demonstrates &#8216;green&#8217; approaches to urban development - for example, with Patrick Blanc&#8217;s green walls, planter boxes across the building facades, and the Chippendale Green open space; and how it implicitly incorporates &#8216;green&#8217; technologies, such as the trigeneration system, water recycling, contemporary glazing and window shading systems. What we are learning, is that there are many ways to be &#8216;green&#8217; when we design and construct new urban precincts. The Central Park project will be an important site to keep studying to determine if it is a useful prototype for future urban development in Sydney.</p>
                  
                  <p>I really appreciated <strong>Terry&#8217;s</strong> (from the UK) comments about England&#8217;s green belts because I was fortunate to have recently spent three weeks driving around the UK. It is so impressive to see how the green belts have contained suburban sprawl, and you can indeed see how the demand for more housing will put pressure on these great preserves. It is absolutely true that continuing this protection requires &#8220;wide spread political buy-in&#8221; and the clear voices of built environment professionals lobbying for it.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Jacob</strong> from Sydney makes an important comment about how crowds at special events in the city put a lot of pressure on Central Park&#8217;s relatively small patch of greenspace - Chippendale Green. As a public park, the management and maintenance of that space is now the City of Sydney&#8217;s responsibility, although it was initially delivered as part of the development of the overall project. And <strong>Natalie</strong> points out in some situations there are serious social and economic considerations associated with tending the urban greenspace, such as in the &#8216;Garden City&#8217; of Singapore, where many of the workers in that industry migrate from neighbouring countries.</p>
                  
                  <p>Although this week&#8217;s presentations have not just been about landscape architecture, I hope you now have a broader understanding of this important profession and, in particular, the role landscape architects play in creating the public domain and strengthening a city&#8217;s resilience in the face of climate change. As a profession, we view urban landscapes as &#8216;green infrastructure&#8217;, essential to a city&#8217;s environmental, social and economic performance and, ultimately, its liveability. Urban landscapes are also regenerative. They give back to the urban environment in many ways, by improving biodiversity, air and water quality, assisting in storm water management, producing food, and importantly, creating beautiful places which are valued by the people who live and work there. And as per <strong>Mark&#8217;s</strong> astute comment: &#8220;the bottom line is really a reflection of the values of those who make up a city&#8221;.</p>

                  <h3 id=""green-space-discussion"">Green Space Discussion</h3>
                  
                  <p>Responses around who should provide greenspaces ranged across the spectrum, from individuals at the grassroots taking it upon themselves to plant greenery and sway local governments and developers, to either the developer or local government. However, people generally agreed there should be a partnership between local governments and developers, to both provide the space and maintain it (with the help of locals, so people can connect with nature and each other). Opinions on no-go zones were divided: several people observed that out-of-bounds areas often attract anti-social behaviour, while others argued the necessity of providing space to conserve threatened species.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Jayne</strong> from NSW suggests that &#8220;you should still be able to view these zones from a distance and they can visually still make an impact in an environment but also provide a quiet place for nature to just be&#8221;.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Raymond&#8217;s</strong> post was well-liked suggesting &#8220;Landscaping and green spaces are crucial in successful urban planning, especially so in areas of hyper-density, the city must be designed with people, fauna and their amenity foremost in the planners mind, a relaxing environment for people, a safe one for fauna and that invariably means nature and landscaping becoming a featured component.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p>The discussion on contribution of a donation/levy received some debate over whether the 40 amount is too high or too low. Most participants appear willing to pay.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Theresa</strong> suggests an option of either a payment or being part of a &#8220;community group that actively participates in the upkeep of the green space.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""bottom-lines-discussion"">Bottom Lines Discussion</h3>
                  
                  <p>Suggestions for measuring social or environmental bottom lines included &#8220;zero carbon effect, walkability of neighbourhood, water consumption,number of green spaces, social gardening, alternative transport means&#8221; (<strong>Sophia</strong> from Athens), basing measures on the Global Reporting Initiative (Terry and Mark), or the &#8220;Circles of Sustainability&#8221; (<strong>Fabian</strong> from Colombia), or increased well-being (<strong>Euphemia</strong> from Nigeria), as well as measuring the &#8220;percentage change of government funding away from building roads for cars and towards improving public transport and building/maintaining a cycle-network and pedestrian-friendly streets&#8221; (<strong>Bron</strong> from Perth).</p>

                  <p>Linda and the rest of the team really loved all your favourite places, just wonderful to see the places and landscapes that inspire people!</p>
                  
                  <p>Here are some examples.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Eleftheria</strong> from London - <a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/oujdvb9dnbeh/wish/127407685"">A Local Path, London</a><br/>
                  &#8220;This was the route from my home to my work for six months. On the right hand is the railroad and on the left too many houses. I felt so lucky, as I could take a breath, hear the birds and smell fresh air or smell the ground during rainy days. Even if the railway is so close to this street, it wasn&#8217;t annoying. The green walls stop efficiently the noise that the trains do.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Clare</strong> from Hong Kong - <a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/oujdvb9dnbeh/wish/126191075"">Urban Gardening in Berlin</a><br/>
                  &#8220;The picture shows an example of urban gardening which is called Himmelbeet in Berlin. The greening is not attached to a particular development which is well planned. Instead, it is located somewhere inside the city, surrounding by different types of developments. I appreciate this type of activities as it is organised by the people living nearby.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Heather</strong> from the UK  - &#8220;I used to love visiting the <a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/oujdvb9dnbeh/wish/126307201"">Toronto Music Garden</a>. Designed by cellist Yo Yo Ma and landscape designer Julie Moir Messervy, it reflects a Bach suite in six different sections. Each is very different in character, and the garden includes a stage and grass risers where concerts are held during the summer.</p>

                  &#8220;This inner city pool fell into disuse and eventually the City of Sydney decided on a complete revamp with sustainability features at the top of the list. The only building includes a caf&#233;, change rooms, office and reception as well as a plant room. It is shaped like a banana. The rear and top of this building are covered in soil and have extensive plantings of native grass. It is a no go area for safety, security and maintenance reasons. I find a certain pleasure in using this facility. It has the quality of &#8220;repose&#8221; in the landscape.&#8221;</p>

                  <p>In <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/re-enchanting-the-city/2/todo/6325"">Week 5</a>, Technopolis, it is all about technology. We examine design innovations in day-lighting, structure, construction, and building services.  It is about how technology can harness nature to serve people; how it can help in making a place liveable, enchanting and poetic. It is also about the people who &#8220;make this happen&#8221;. Central Park&#8217;s stand-out features are the amazing 45m, 110 tons cantilevered heliostat tracking the sun and the 1110m2 of vertical gardens growing plants 100m in the air, called &#8220;living architecture&#8221;. Both are discussed in this module as to why they are important and the role they may play in re-enchantment. To this end, industrial designers collaborated with engineers, horticulturalists, and botanists to make it happen.</p>

In the early hours of Friday 1 February, a 110 tonne steel frame was lifted 100 metres into the sky, high above Sydney&#8217;s Broadway in Chippendale, and fixed to the side of a dramatic residential tower, forever changing the profile of Broadway.

                  Architects in Sydney, Australia have found a way to light up a part of the city that was once perpetually dark, hidden from the sun by tall buildings. They&#8217;ve done it by capturing the sunshine, and bouncing it between buildings with an architectural device called a heliostat. Lester Ranby reports (YouTube).</p>

                  <h3 id=""reflection-from-dr-miles-park"">Reflection from Dr Miles Park</h3>
                  
                  <p>Thank you to everyone who have shared many thoughtful comments and examples of how design, and technology impact upon all our lives.</p>
                  
                  <p>We commenced the week by describing Industrial Design through the lens of technology. As we have seen, technology plays a featured role in the Central Park development. Notably the striking heliostat and mirrors on the cantilever platform.</p>
                  
                  <p>We asked you to identify criteria than an Industrial Designer needs to consider. Many of you identified key criteria such as functionality and aesthetics, to create products that are useful and desirable. Other contributors extended the discussion to include durability, simplicity to use, manufacturing and materials, marketing, affordability, maintenance and safety. These and other criteria will vary in importance and prioritised depending on the product.</p>
                  
                  <p>We asked you to identify a favourite product or object that you love and cannot live without. Technology screen based devices featured heavily as favourites. With the rate of technological change, I wonder if we would choose these same objects in a few year&#8217;s time?</p>
                  
                  <p>As an aside, the National Museum of Australia is hosting an exhibition on loan from the British Museum titled, <em>A history of the world in 100 objects</em>.  <a href=""http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/saturdayextra/geraldine-and-the-currator-of-the-nma's-100-objects/7847538"">Click here</a> to read a discussion about the exhibition and the significance of these objects.</p>
                  
                  <p>We also asked you to identify a hidden or embedded technology in your environment?  There are many things we encounter daily and take for granted or do not notice. It was rewarding to be reminded of the many wonderful things that enable our modern society to function. From high-tech satellites that bring us communications and Internet, infrastructure networks that provide electricity in water to a homes, and to the ubiquitous traffic light.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""design-criteria-discussion"">Design Criteria Discussion</h3>
                  
                  <p><strong>Fabian</strong> from Cali, Colombia summed this up well, receiving many likes from other learners. His list includes:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>Functional (In short, should be useful)</li>
                    <li>Resistant (Ability to support themselves and their daily use)</li>
                    <li>Ergonomic (should be comfortable for human use)</li>
                    <li>Durable (Refers to the quality and durability over time)</li>
                    <li>Insurance (Must be the least dangerous possible)</li>
                    <li>Sustainable (environmentally responsible)</li>
                    <li>Aesthetic (Being visually pleasing)</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p><strong>Catherine</strong> from London identified user experience, stating: &#8220;User Experience Design (UXD) has become a bit of a buzzword, but I think it is right to remember that what is being designed has to be used by people - and they have got to want as well as need to use it. <a href=""http://semanticstudios.com/user_experience_design/"">This blog</a> is quite nice on the subject. It&#8217;s by a web designer, but the principles hold for all design, I think.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Ian</strong> from Newcastle-under-Lyme, discussed a <a href=""https://www.brompton.com/The-Bike/Benefits"">folding bike</a> as a good example of industrial design, which initiated a discussion on affordability vs good design and quality.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Damian</strong> identified the Portable Roll-Up Travel Bag, called Rolo, which took into account the following criteria:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>storage (and organising) of shirts / pants, underwear, etc. within the bag</li>
                    <li>ability to hang the bag off of a door / wardrobe</li>
                    <li>a carry strap, to allow carrying over the shoulder</li>
                    <li>compact solution for separating the basic clothing, to allow for ease of finding when traveling</li>
                    <li>simple design</li>
                    <li>good workmanship</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <h3 id=""design-research-discussion"">Design Research Discussion</h3>
                  
                  <p>The discussion moved onto design research where Associate Professor Oya Demirbilek discussed the design process identifying user requirements and logistical considerations. The question posed for participants related design research to simple kitchen appliances. The discussion crossed over into what is important for people in the products they use. Some of the appliance mentioned were toasters, the kitchen sink, coffee bean grinder, hand blender, rice cooker, gas cooker, microwave.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Heather</strong> in the UK shared her experience with looking for appliances that meet the needs of her partner who is blind. She identified safety and non-visual controls as criteria.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Terry</strong> from the UK raised important points about marketing that try to convince people of what&#8217;s essential in their lives. He also stated: &#8220;The question about a simple kitchen appliance begs a further question about who&#8217;s kitchen. For many families clean water, access to a tap and sanitation are very real human needs. An efficient lightweight device to ease the daily struggle for women and children as they draw water from a well would benefit many.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""products-and-objects-we-love-discussion"">Products and Objects we Love Discussion</h3>
                  
                  <p><strong>Euphemia</strong> from Nigeria identified FutureLearn as her favourite product. &#8220;Words can&#8217;t describe the huge knowledge I take home from this product.&#8221; She praised the leaning material, community support, discussion activity and how &#8220;I&#8217;m constantly engaged in critical thinking thereby refining my brain. My communication skills, public speaking, knowledge building and application are frequently on the uplift due to this product. Also worthy of mention are the educators and learners.&#8221; Thanks Euphemia for reminding us of the value of courses on this platform and the team here is pleased to hear the impact on you.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Vikras</strong> from Chandigarh, India &#8211; <a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/kavx7qwtl6jb/wish/128060000"">My Water Bottle</a><br/>
                  &#8220;In love with this wonderful work of art for many reasons. We usually don&#8217;t drink much water, but this shouts out loud to face that I must drink water. The design is sleek, elegant and not the conventional water bottles or tumblers that we use in our offices. Can we used to bringing some fresh juice from my own kitchen. The bottle is see through and therefore enhances the space on my office desk.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Natalie</strong> &#8211; <a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/kavx7qwtl6jb/wish/127707096"">Wireless speaker</a><br/>
                  &#8220;This product has helped me to rediscover music. It is beautifully designed with a minimal aesthetic that allows it to discreetly blend into the background. Its small size, lightweight design and wireless technology makes it highly portable, meaning I can take the music with me from room to room or even outside for barbecues and picnics. It is easy to operate with a simple on off touch button and easily connects to my phone via bluetooth.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Stephen</strong> &#8211; <a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/kavx7qwtl6jb/wish/127853667"">Apple Time Machine</a><br/>
                  &#8220;Centralised wireless backup system for desktop, laptop, iPad iPhone etc. just plug it in, follow a few online instructions and you&#8217;re set. No complicated programming, no it setup guy no need for phone support. Compact and easy for a non tech savvy person to use.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Mark</strong> from Sydney &#8211; <a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/kavx7qwtl6jb/wish/128058764"">Wrist watch</a><br/>
                  &#8220;It&#8217;s a perfect size for my wrist, the dial and hands are sufficiently large and have good luminance contrast for my fading eye sight even in the dead of night (it&#8217;s highly luminous even after 8 hours in darkness). This watch is extremely robust, water proof way beyond any depth I could dive to and the automatic movement enhances its resilience as there is no battery life to consider.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Heather</strong> - <a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/kavx7qwtl6jb/wish/127804543"">Mechanical pencil</a><br/>
                  &#8220;Aside from formal documents and my signature I pretty much always write in pencil, and I can&#8217;t stand sharpening them. For me, a good mechanical pencil with an 0.5mm lead is essential. I like this one because it&#8217;s got a sturdy metal clip (I play with my pencil and have broken countless plastic clips) and a good if not easy-to-keep-clean comfort grip. And it&#8217;s got a good size eraser which can be exposed simply by twisting the top of the pencil. My only complaint would be lack of fun colours!&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""technology-in-your-environment-discussion"">Technology in your Environment Discussion</h3>
                  
                  <p><strong>Ian</strong> from Newcastle-under-Lyme: &#8220;The hidden technology that probably contributes most to city life is the sewerage system&#8230; Re-enchantment may be as simple as remembering&#8230;&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Eleftheria</strong>: &#8220;The Underground station of London. You travel too many metres under the ground and you don&#8217;t realise the distance and the speed. It&#8217;s just amazing.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Peter</strong> from Sydney reminds us of what we can take for granted : &#8220;&#8220;I like hot water and it is only when this is not available that people take notice. For instance, when the hot water system breaks down and you have to take cold showers until the plumber arrives.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Muaz</strong> from Qatar:&#8221;An occupancy sensor is a lighting or heating control device that detects occupancy of a space by people and turns the lights and/or Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system on or off automatically, using infrared, ultrasonic, microwave, or other technology. Even used for using of waters from the taps or flushing the toilets. 
                  Occupancy sensors are typically used to save energy, provide automatic control, and comply with building codes.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Euphemia</strong> from Nigeria: &#8220;&#8220;Light is a vital component of the environment and one we can&#8217;t live without&#8230;  light bulbs, rechargeable lanterns/torches, mobile phone light, solar light among others&#8230; have made life easier and conducive in our cities.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""other-contributions"">Other Contributions</h3>
                  
                  <p><strong>Susan</strong> from Sydney shared a link of <a href=""http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-30/the-gentrification-of-sydneys-chippendale-in-photos/7883972"">interactive photos of the changes to Chippendale</a>. Dr Miles Park noted that this provides a &#8220;fascinating glimpse of how the location has changed over the last half century&#8230; how trams once ran along Parramatta road - the main thoroughfare running past the Central Park precinct. Here is an <a href=""http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/earshot/swamp-squat-skol-a-history-of-chippendale/7868074"">ABC podcast related to this</a>.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Nicole</strong> from Sydney shared a video link illustrating unintended consequences of technology:
                  <a href=""https://youtu.be/Xc2i0g_88uY?list=PLdA69uWAjtQ81Or50esmwx_oqNj-BV29y"">Walkie Talkie Skyscraper Beam &#8216;Melts Cars&#8217;</a></p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Jose</strong> from Norfolk, UK noted the influence and impact of art on thoughts and behaviour in response to the Halo video. &#8220;A piece of art, flowing through any of the expressions of art, enhances the way people can appreciate the soul and essence of a space or place.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>What&#8217;s Next?</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>In <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/re-enchanting-the-city/2/todo/6326"">Week 6</a>, Inside Out, we zoom to the human scale and talk to the concepts of the interior room vs urban room (exterior). Exteriors are what is marketed and is purchased, sold and photographed, but interiors are where people dwell.  This week looks at the role of interiority in an urban development, and in a city. It looks at the relationships between the outside and the inside. Early drawings of this development relied heavily on the sense of living inside green walls, almost like living in a forest or treehouse. This week will look at interior design, within the apartments and shopping centre, through the frame of this inside-out relationship. How the light and greenery is brought inside; how private space relates/contributes to public space, and vice versa; how inside and outside interact.</p>

                  <p>This week has explored key design considerations for interior architecture that have included - scale, materials, circulation, inside out relationships, and inspiration from nature.</p>
                  
                  <p>Drawing on what you have learned, select a building with which you feel a strong impact of moving across the inside-out threshold. Do you sense a change of scale? Do the materials and lighting influence the experience? What emotions does the circulation pattern evoke?</p>
                  
                  <p>Here we have the Macquarie Bank building in Martin Place, Sydney, which was built in 1928 as the State Savings Bank, and recently renovated. As you walk though the main doors, there is a sense of grandeur and wealth, into the teller space of the old bank.</p>

                    <p>Look at the responses by others and add Likes and comments (suggest at least 3) to those which resonate with you.</p>

                  <p>When you launch the survey task below, you will be asked the same question you were previously asked in Week 1,  to see if your understanding of cities has changed during the course. The question is, &#8216;In your opinion, what are the most important elements of a city, that contribute to enchantment?&#8217; Again we would recommend selecting your top three (3) elements.</p>

                  <p>Thank you for the continued engagement in this final week of the course. It is uplifting for the Built Environment team to read your contributions.</p>

                  <h3 id=""bruce-watsons-reflection"">Bruce Watson&#8217;s Reflection</h3>
                  
                  <p>The profession of Interior Architecture provides a service that deals with clients&#8217; needs and the greater requirements of the breadth of contexts associated with these needs within societies and global contexts.</p>
                  
                  <p>Each project is different and hence each response to that project is different. This project was but one example of &#8216;a&#8217; way of operating around a specific site and a specific brief. Interior Architecture as a profession cannot be homogenised in one general way of operating; it varies from city to city, country to country, Interior Architect to Interior Architect.</p>
                  
                  <p>The business of Interior Architecture endeavours to interpret a client&#8217;s needs and then align and delivery on those needs ethically in terms of the Interior Architect&#8217;s own ethical positioning within the framework of large societal and global contexts. The Interior and the way humans operate, live, work, heal and play at an &#8216;Interior&#8217; scale is the specialist realm of an Interior Architect.</p>
                  
                  <p>From a sustainable perspective; Interior Architecture as one of the professions working within the construction industry, developing an understanding and approach to the Life Cycle of materials  is an essential part of an Interior Architects role. What is the material selected? How large is it embedded energy? Where/how was it sourced and where will it go at the end of its life? These questions and more are the type of processes that ethical people would consider as part of a design process.</p>
                  
                  <p>Consumer research is for some projects part of the process; though these mostly take the form of a &#8216;feasibility study&#8217;. The feasibility study then informs the clients knowledge about what &#8216;is&#8217; and what &#8216;isn&#8217;t&#8217; needed and is the brief suitable for the site. This then drives the clients brief to the interior architect, in essence the client of a built project in most instances  is the driver of what &#8216;consumers&#8217; are presented with in a commercial setting.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""summary-of-ideas"">Summary of Ideas</h3>
                  
                  <p>Where does an &#8216;interior&#8217; start and &#8216;architecture&#8217; finish? Generally people felt that, while you might distinguish between them, you couldn&#8217;t separate the two. Participants described this in various ways - <strong>Rachel</strong> says it&#8217;s &#8220;symbiotic&#8221;, <strong>Natalie</strong> that &#8220;architecture and interior go hand in hand as both have a direct effect on the other&#8221;, while <strong>Jose</strong> from the UK sees architects as &#8220;the master creators of the design of a building including its context and its interiors and its surroundings, and then they hand off the &#8220;baton&#8221; to the rest of the team&#8221;.</p>
                  
                  <p>The importance of cooperation, and the growing complexity and specialisation of built environment design, was a theme that arose often. <strong>Vineta</strong> from Latvia/UK adds that this working together is &#8220;why I find architecture and design so interesting - it&#8217;s such a great way to see teamwork and people working within their own specialist fields closely together with other specialists and having such understanding with each other. That&#8217;s what makes me believe in humanity in the 21st century when we might think we&#8217;ve lost it :)&#8221;. <strong>Biljana</strong> from Montenegro paraphrased a Chinese thinker saying interior architecture is the essence of architecture, &#8220;an art of shaping and organizing the void (of space)&#8221;.</p>
                  
                  <p>There was a discussion around the connection between designer and final user of the space, and whose needs/desires are addressed. <strong>Tangumonkem</strong> thought &#8220;interior design must always come out to reflect the personality of the designer&#8221;, <strong>Raymond</strong> and <strong>Vikas</strong> noted that the designed seemed skewed more towards &#8220;the needs of the developer and collaborating professionals&#8221;, while <strong>Catherine</strong> pointed out that the developer &#8220;has to anticipate and then market to actual residents&#8221; and <strong>Stephen</strong> noted that &#8220;In Australia the interiors of new apartment buildings are always designed to a hypothetical future purchaser and are not personalised to the feel and touch of the end user.. The importance of consumer research and public consultation was underlined, and the possibility of a middle ground between bare, shell apartments and fully finished apartments, &#8220;where an off the plan purchaser can negotiate the level of finish in the apartment&#8221; (Stephen).</p>
                  
                  <p>There were some great ideas about how to make cities more green, liveable and poetic. Many people would like to see more greenery in their cities, with <strong>Andrei</strong> from Romania planning  &#8220;more parks now and then so that we can rest to the shade of a tree in the summer and drink a hot chocolate in the winter&#8221;. <strong>Sophia</strong> from Athens suggested &#8220;provision of greenery, open spaces with trees and maybe public allotments with plants for everyone who wants to experience planting&#8221;, <strong>Natalie</strong> from Singapore (originally from Sydney) would like more &#8220;small scale neighbourhood shopping streets &#8230; interest in fine-grained character&#8221;, and . Several people talked about walkability and the balance of cars, public transport, cycling and walking. <strong>Muaz</strong> from Khartoum, Sudan &#8220;will create different hyperdensity zones to be as remarkable example of liveable and green and poetic&#8221;.</p>

                  <p><strong>Nikki</strong> from Philippines - <a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/k1jd43or2c44/wish/129772257"">local coffee shop</a><br/>
                  &#8220;This is a local coffee shop and currently my favorite place since I almost always go here after office hours and in weekends to continue working, to read, or even just to chill out. The interior &#8211; chairs, tables, divider, cashier, and even the window blinds are all made of wood. The main color motif in the caf&#233; is brown which complements the wood theme. Like Koichi&#8217;s design it displays organic luxury, it is homey and comfortable. At the same time the place is busy, with a lot of people doing different kinds of stuff that I think helps me to be more productive.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Jenny</strong> - <a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/k1jd43or2c44/wish/130025880"">Sangoma Retreat, Blue Mountain</a><br/>
                  &#8220;The retreat sits in the foothills of blue mountain with splendid city and bush views, the design inspired and influenced by Glenn Murcutt&#8217;s work, the combination of concrete block wall, timber ceiling, steel frame of timber deck create harmonious environment with surrounding. it is a great weekend gateway for visitors and Sydneysiders.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Vikas</strong> from Chandigarh, India - <a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/k1jd43or2c44/wish/130022441"">Casa Bella Vista cafe, Chandigarh</a><br/>
                  &#8220;This cafe is my favorite place in the city, my Sunday brunch destination- no matter if I go alone or with a bunch of friends. The cafe is located in a crowded residential area. One has to pass few crowded gullies to reach here, and the ambiance is serene and peaceful. The off white furniture goes perfectly with some good sun, food, and vertical walls boasting of pink bougainvillea.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Catherine</strong> from London - <a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/k1jd43or2c44/wish/130906119"">bathroom tiles</a><br/>
                  &#8220;I thought my bathroom tiles reflect me, my peers and professional London life pretty well. Like many Londoners, I live in a flat converted from what was once a large family home. Yes, I have painted most of the walls white. The tiles are contemporary (mad in Spain) but hint at Victorian style albeit in a more neutral palette. My parents gave me some of their mid-century furniture (Robin Day Hillestak chairs, for instance). I think there is probably more of Koichi&#8217;s approach, on balance.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <h4 id=""inspiring-thresholds"">Inspiring Thresholds</h4>
                  
                  <p><strong>Heather</strong> from the UK: &#8220;I love the <a href=""http://www.fosterandpartners.com/projects/great-court-at-the-british-museum/"">Great Court at the British Museum</a>, and how what was once outside is now inside. The roof is beautiful but simple enough so as not to detract from the older architecture. It&#8217;s such an astonishing structure though, and the geometry really accentuates the roof&#8217;s height, reflecting the grandeur of the institution itself and hinting at the amazing discoveries one can find within. It really unifies the space.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Vineta</strong> from Riga, Latvia and London, England: &#8220;I have always felt a huge impact on me when I walk into an old church/cathedral. I&#8217;m pretty sure that has nothing to do with religion, as I wouldn&#8217;t really call myself religious at all. I guess for me it is entering a space full of contrasts. Contrast of light and dark, as the tower tops inside the cathedral are usually quite dark, but there&#8217;s always enormous amount of windows to draw natural light in and make a balanced contrast happen. Contrast of scale: huge and small - as the tower height is usually enormous, at the same time you&#8217;d see very detailed paintings and icons, which you know required small brushes and a lot of patience to be made. One of my favorite cathedrals is <a href=""http://www.doms.lv/gallery/"">Riga Dome Cathedral</a>, you can see the pictures in the link.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Andrei</strong>, high school  student from Romania: &#8220;The <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/aguichard/3803200759"">St. Mary Axe</a> is built at the intersection of two streets where the sidewalks are relatively small. It&#8217;s a great building, next to an all-glass-made building, which might be new. I thought about this building and it came to me that the inside outside connection might not work on this building because, when you enter it you are amazed of the sight, if you go to a much higher level you won&#8217;t have words to describe it and if you are done with the visiting and walk out of the building you won&#8217;t have the same amazing impression you had when you walked in. So I think that the inside outside connection really depends on the looks of the street and the attitude of the people.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Ken</strong> from Sydney: &#8220;Thinking about the building I work in makes me realise the inside outside connection might work in one direction but not the other. My building has a large atrium directly inside with ceiling to floor glass. Walking through revolving doors into the atrium is an inviting experience. But when you look outwards through the glass and walk out you simply land on a narrow footpath next to a busy street. So the threshold is pleasant coming in but not so going out. Thinking about a better solution.. .perhaps some of the extensive interior space could have been given over to create an exterior landing space.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Jayne</strong> from NSW - <a href=""http://www.visitvictoria.com/Regions/The-Murray/Food-and-wine/Restaurants/American-Hotel-Echuca.aspx"">The American Hotel Echuca</a><br/>
                  &#8220;This is the oldest hotel in the area and has been renovated keeping all the heritage features as well as adding extensions that connect to inside to outside areas. This building is interesting because it tastefully mixes heritage features and modern new spaces. As you walk around the hotel there are various sitting areas which feel spacious and connected to each other. I like the feeling that you can move to another spot and discover a new view. You really get the feeling your inside and outside at the same time. This hotel also creates a fun social feeling as you always can see what&#8217;s going on around you. It is an environment that is modern but comfortable, and has a timeless quality.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <h4 id=""making-hyperdense-cities-green-liveable-and-poetic"">Making Hyperdense Cities Green, Liveable and Poetic</h4>
                  
                  <p><strong>Tangumonkem</strong> from Cameroon: &#8220;If i had the power and authority to influence change in the development of my city, I would create more greens and make sure that no building is constructed without a green space to permit the children to have where to play and to feel free. I will create more artificial waterfalls and hanging gardens, more parks containing protected species of birds, insects, small animals and really make the city the place to be, where visitors would just wish to enjoy. I would facilitate drainage to take away mud and to make everywhere environmental friendly.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Eleftheria</strong>: &#8220;London is a metropolitan city. This doesn&#8217;t mean that there not neighborhoods with green places. Even if you live in the central London, you have a choice to take the Underground or the bus and after a while you are in a completely different place. Less crowded, more green. Not only that. You can find a secret green paradise just close to a high speed road or a railway&#8230;. If I could change something, this is the parking spaces. I understand that we have to use our cars. I totally understand that car is like a second home for many of us. However, just one car can destroy a lovely scenery.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Jacob</strong>: &#8220;I live in central Sydney. There are some absolutely stunning green spaces all around the CBD area. For me, there is too much car traffic in the CBD. I would love to see a bigger focus on pedestrians, cyclists and public transport users, with the CBD being used less for through-traffic and more as a destination to work, live and enjoy. Hopefully the new light rail can help with some of this.&#8221;</p>
