                  <p>60 years of classic textbooks defined the traditional Engineering Mechanics course. They decided what should be in them and how to teach it. They still do.</p>
                  
                  <p>Online courses like this offer new ways of presenting Engineering Mechanics, and we&#8217;ve freed ourselves from the traditional course structure. So as well as Engineering Mechanics we have guest appearances from material science, mechanics of solids, and fluid mechanics - whatever is needed for supporting design activities, and for developing Engineers&#8217; Eyes.
                  Engineering Mechanics is based on mathematics. It&#8217;s an essential part of its magic. But we&#8217;ll keep the mathematics simple. You&#8217;ll need basic algebra and trigonometry. There is no calculus.</p>
                  
                  <p>We&#8217;ll live in the moment. But you can also use this course to prepare for future formal courses, or review what you have learnt in the past.</p>
                  
                  <p>The full suite of activities would take up to four hours a week, for seven weeks. But you can pick and choose which parts you would like to do.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>In this activity, we would like to know about your reactions so far. For example: what segments appeal to you and why; what do you want to get from this course?</strong></p>

                  <p>Did you see how we split Engineering Mechanics into &#8216;Statics&#8217; and &#8216;Dynamics&#8217;. Textbooks generally come in two separate volumes, one for each.</p>
                  
                  <p>There are those who say that it&#8217;s all Dynamics really, and what we call statics is just Dynamics where the accelerations are all zero. But we think Statics and Dynamics are different enough to justify the split.</p>
                  
                  <p>But are Statics and Dynamics so clearly differentiated from one another?</p>
                  
                  <p>There are situations where accelerations definitely exist, but where we can ignore them for all practical purposes. As an extreme example, there are accelerations when the bands creep, but these miniscule accelerations don&#8217;t affect the forces significantly. This is what you might call quasi-static, that is, we know there are accelerations but we can still treat the situation as though it were static.</p>
                  
                  <p>If you attempted the experiment, remember to take a photo and upload it to our <a href=""http://padlet.com/ThroughEngineersEyes/Week1Experiment"" title=""Through Engineers' Eyes Padlet wall"">Through Engineers&#8217; Eyes Padlet wall</a>. You can include a link to your photo in the discussion for this step (click on your post on the Padlet wall and then copy the web address).</p>
                  
                  <p>Did you work out why a chain of bands produces a larger deflection than a single band?
                  What else did you notice?</p>
                  
                  <p>Did you try any of the experiments yourself? We&#8217;d like to know which, if any, you got your hands on. If you did do some, what did you find? What would you recommend your colleagues to do?</p>
                  
                  <p>By now you will have seen how simple experiments can give you insights. After all, physical reality is physical reality, however you look at it. But is it worth the effort of doing the experiments yourself?</p>

                  <p>There&#8217;s no better way to consolidate learning in Engineering Mechanics than quietly working through problems using pencil and paper (that&#8217;s why we call this a &#8216;Retro Tutorial&#8217;). It can be satisfying too.</p>
                  
                  <p>&#8216;Retro&#8217; means a modern version of an older style, like a modern car based on a classic from a past era. Tutorial means questions for you to practise your new skills on. You will do them on paper with a pencil and a scientific calculator.</p>
                  
                  <p>This tutorial is mainly about springs. If you do all the questions it might take <strong>45 minutes</strong>.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Download the tutorial in the Downloads section below and work through the questions.</strong>
                  It includes solutions. It&#8217;s probably best if you try the problem first before looking at the solution. We find that those who look at the solution and decide &#8220;I could have done that&#8221; are often kidding themselves.</p>

                  <p>Did you think of the effect of creep when the transducer was calibrated and used? To help keep it under control it would be good to minimise the time between loading up and measuring.</p>
                  
                  <p>Measuring the deflection with a rule is tricky too. Was I being hopeful when I suggested that a precision of +/- 1 mm was possible?</p>
                  
                  <p>Did it seem odd to have the weight of a &#8220;washer&#8221; as the unit of force? Before SI units were common the unit of force was often the weight of a standard mass. In some places it still is, for example the unit of mass in US customary units is the pound (the pound mass), and the unit of force is the weight of a pound mass (the pound weight). We&#8217;ll have more on weight later.</p>
                  
                  <p>Mostly with US customary units the term &#8216;pound&#8217; is used for both mass and weight, leaving you to work out what is meant from the context. This can be confusing but it won&#8217;t affect us much because we&#8217;ll generally use SI units, where the unit of mass is the kilogram and the unit of force is the Newton.</p>

                  <p>There&#8217;s no better way to consolidate learning in Engineering Mechanics than quietly working through problems using pencil and paper (that&#8217;s why we call this a &#8216;Retro Tutorial&#8217;).</p>
                  
                  <p>This is a fine example of why the retro-tutorials are included. Producing an FBD is a creative activity. You start with a &#8216;real-world&#8217; scenario and you need to end up with an abstraction of it to analyse.</p>
                  
                  <p>Drawing an FBD from scratch is so different from selecting a preferred solution from a gallery of options. We&#8217;ll use the backward-looking gallery format to assess what you have learnt, but this forward-looking format is much more like real life.</p>
                  
                  <p>So don&#8217;t throw this opportunity away by looking at the solution first! It should only take a moment to sketch the specified FBDs.</p>
                  
                  <p>Depending upon your grasp of basic trigonometry you might want to do the revision questions on that topic. But whatever your degree of prior knowledge it would be good to do at least some of the problems on components and resultants.</p>
                  
                  <p>This tutorial is in two parts: 1  Free-Body Diagrams and 2  basic trigonometry, with a bonus question at the end.</p>
                  
                  <p>The FBD questions are highly recommended. Expect to spend up to <strong>20 minutes</strong>.</p>
                  
                  <p>The questions on trigonometry will be revision for some, and, perhaps, less familiar to others. If you are confident in your trigonometry just review them. Otherwise go though them in detail and check out the solutions.  The time to do these will depend on what you already know.</p>
                  
                  <p>The bonus question is quick and (I think) fun.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Download the tutorial in the Downloads section below and work through the questions.</strong> It includes solutions. It&#8217;s probably best if you try the problem first before looking at the solution.</p>

                  <p>The balancing experiment has some hidden features. For example, by pinning the cardboard in its centre its weight doesn&#8217;t come into consideration. Also the vertical distance between the centre hole and the holes for the hangers determines the sensitivity of the system.

                  <p>The equations and data in this week&#8217;s retro tutorial are taken from actual engineering practice. It will be a fine contribution towards developing engineers&#8217; eyes.</p>
                  
                  <p>You will cover rolling resistance for trains, analyse aerodynamic forces on the glider of week 4, and the range of the miniature vehicle we analysed this week.</p>
                  
                  <p>If you do them all and get hooked it might take <strong>an hour</strong>, but it will be worth it for the sheer existential pleasure of it all.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Download the tutorial in the Downloads section below and work through the questions.</strong> It includes solutions. It&#8217;s probably best if you try the problem first before looking at the solution.</p>

                  <p>Dear Participants,<br/>
                  It is my great pleasure in thanking you all for participating in the first iteration of this course and providing us with enough encouragement, constructive comments and motivation to continue offering this course again. Your comments and suggestions are very valuable to us and we will look into each one of them very carefully!</p>
                  
                  <p>Robin has been the backbone of this course and Jay&#8217;s contribution has been phenomenal. This course offering could not have been possible without the full support of my colleagues John Vulic and Moein Ghodrati who worked behind the scene uninterruptedly over the last several months. Thank you all!</p>
                  
                  <p>We will offer the course again on 5th September 2016. Feel free to let your friends and colleagues know about it.</p>
                  
                  <p>Best wishes<br/>
                  Gangadhara Prusty</p>
