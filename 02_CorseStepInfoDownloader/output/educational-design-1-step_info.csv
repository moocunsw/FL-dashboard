                  <p>In the <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/programs/university-learning-and-teaching"">Foundations of Learning and Teaching</a> (FULT) program, you have the option to develop an ePortfolio to support your development as a reflective practitioner, by collecting evidence from the course activities and discussions. A portfolio is a a selection of work (reflection, references, activities) compiled over a period of time and used for assessing performance or progress.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""purpose"">Purpose</h3>
                  <p>To help you develop connections between the program and your workplace and to link theory to practice through discussion and analysis of key issues that interest you and your peers. Your portfolio will be used in two ways:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>record your general reflections about teaching and learning during the course (not for submission)</li>
                    <li>complete the required portfolio activities drawing on your experiences during the program and copy these into the ePortfolio submission template, <a href=""https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/files/c7/03/c703c62e-92b0-49dc-9a1b-42fdad89f525/Reflective_ePortfolio_summary_template_FINAL.pdf"">PDF Version</a> or <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8J6ocSUIZjSSzdZZzRkaDh3amc/view"">MS WORD</a> version, for submission in the <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/programs/university-learning-and-teaching/assessment"">Assessment Course</a>. (<strong>NOTE</strong>: The headings in the PDF template can also be copied into an editable document for you to complete.)</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p><strong>Reflective practice</strong>: documenting your reflections related to your own practice, is for your own personal purposes, not for direct submission. Maintaining a record of your reflections will provide the information you need to write up your final portfolio task.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Peer sharing</strong>: although you won&#8217;t be directly required to submit these personal reflections we suggest it would be useful to share them with a peer to gain insight into different perspectives.
                  We have provided a peer review activity at the end of the course for you to share one of your portfolio tasks with your peers.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Collecting evidence</strong>: to complete the FULT program you will be asked to submit artefacts from your FULT learning, so it will be useful to collect and keep a copy of these as part of your reflection.</p>
                  
                  <p>These include:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>quotes from your reflective writing, or from the posts that have been critical in prompting your thinking;</li>
                    <li>references to readings and research that have influenced you;</li>
                    <li>lesson plans you have developed;</li>
                    <li>mini-evaluations your have undertaken and other forms such as images you have captured or created.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <h3 id=""reflecting-in-your-portfolio"">Reflecting in your portfolio</h3>
                  
                  <p>In writing your reflection you can:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>write brief notes or point form phrases</li>
                    <li>observe others and describe what you learn from them</li>
                    <li>listen to what your peers/colleagues have to say about issues that you raise for discussion and use the different perspectives to deepen your personal reflection</li>
                    <li>ask yourself &#8216;what&#8217; &#8216;why&#8217; and &#8216;how&#8217; questions to discover why a situation you experienced or observed could be a valuable stimulus for reflection and learning.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <h3 id=""eportfolio-activities-overall-length-3000-words"">ePortfolio activities (Overall length: 3000 words)</h3>

                  <p>There are many competing demands on educational design, for example, these demands may come from: yourself as the teacher, your students, your discipline, your university or institution, professional bodies, funding bodies and more. How do you resolve competing tensions when designing a course?</p>

                  <p>In the first course of this program, <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/learning-and-teaching/1/"">Introduction to Learning and Teaching in Higher Education</a>, you were introduced to the theory of constructivism.</p>
                  
                  <p>While constructivism is not a specific pedagogy, it may support a specific pedagogical approach to teaching. In this step we introduce you to the concept of constructive alignment as a design model for learning. Constructive alignment is one example of a pedagogical approach based on constructivism. UNSW has adopted this approach, for course and program level design, mapping and review and it also supports the <strong>Integrated Curriculum Framework</strong> (refer to <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/educational-design/1/steps/166485"">Step 1.12</a>).</p>
                  
                  <p>Constructive alignment is about defining the learning outcomes and aligning them with teaching and assessment strategies (Biggs, 1999). It will help you select your course content and plan the learning activities. Success can then be measured through assessment of a student&#8217;s achievement of learning outcomes.</p>
                  
                  <p>A good starting point is to ask yourself the question:</p>
                  
                  <p><em>&#8216;What knowledge do I want my students to be able to apply when they have completed my course&#8217;?</em></p>
                  
                  <p>This question will inform your course&#8217;s learning outcomes and assessment tasks. It will also help you determine the appropriate learning activities and resources required to achieve the learning outcomes. The three essential components in your course are the:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>learning outcomes</li>
                    <li>learning and teaching activities</li>
                    <li>assessment tasks.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>What does constructive alignment mean in practice? When following a model of constructive alignment for designing a course ask yourself these three questions:</p>
                  
                  <p>1) What do I want students to learn?</p>
                  
                  <p>2) What teaching methods and curriculum design will I use to encourage students to behave in ways that are likely to achieve these outcomes?</p>
                  
                  <p>3) What assessment tasks and criteria will tell me that students have achieved the outcomes?</p>

                  <p>Within a university setting when using a constructive alignment approach the expectation is that Course Learning Outcomes (CLO) should clearly link to one or more Program Learning Outcomes (PLO). To make sure that these two levels of outcomes align, you can use curriculum mapping.</p>
                  
                  <p>Curriculum mapping involves the collection of data on the key components of the curriculum. Depending on the level at which the mapping activity is undertaken, these key components may include data on program level and course level learning outcomes, content, assessment and evaluation. The curriculum mapping process then focuses on reviewing, or mapping, curriculum coverage including identifying areas of overlap or over-concentration. Alternatively, you may discover gaps in the curriculum.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""why-use-curriculum-mapping-to-ensure-constructive-alignment"">Why use curriculum mapping to ensure constructive alignment?</h3>
                  
                  <p>&#8226; Students need to be clear about what they are achieving throughout their studies. There needs to be transparency in the knowledge, skills and application of these, being targeted across all course. This makes sure that graduates from any course or program achieve the stated aims and  program level outcomes</p>
                  
                  <p>&#8226; Staff need to have a shared understanding of what a program is teaching, and how their course fits within it. Engaging in curriculum mapping can also improve communication about curriculum among faculty and encourage reflective practice (RIT, n.d.)</p>
                  
                  <p>&#8226; Universities need to be able to guarantee that students have a consistent and high quality
                  educational experience.</p>

In this step we look at Universal Design and its role in creating equal opportunities for diverse learners in the university classroom.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""background-to-universal-design"">Background to Universal Design</h3>
                  
                  <p>You may have heard the term Universal Design used in relation to the built environment. Devised in the late 1980s by Ron Mace, an architect, product designer, educator and disability advocate from North Carolina State University who wanted to design products that were usable by everyone &#8220;regardless of their age, ability, or status in life&#8221; (Centre for Universal Design, 2008).</p>
                  
                  <p>Today, Universal Design is an approach that aims to design spaces, products, systems or services so that they can be used universally by anyone. Universal design recognises that people have a range of different impairments, body types, ways of thinking and being, abilities, skills, interests and needs. It recognises that the features of a design could form barriers for some people (Wikipedia), and works &#8211; often inclusively with the end users &#8211; to eliminate those barriers. For example, designing a footpath with curb cuts can help make sure that a range of users will be able to use the space on equal terms.</p>
                  
                  <p>The principles of Universal Design are equal opportunity, flexibility, adjustability, perceptibility of information, and simplicity of use. Universal Design starts from assessing the diverse requirements of end users, rather than building a product that must later be adapted, or &#8220;retrofitted&#8221; to meet a person&#8217;s needs.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""universal-design-for-learning"">Universal Design for Learning</h3>
                  
                  <p>In the context of learning, Universal Design principles have inspired the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework, which combines the principles of Universal Design with theories of learning from cognitive neuroscience [CAST, 2015]. Universal design is closely aligned with the concepts of equity, diversity, accessibility and inclusivity.</p>
                  
                  <p>The UDL framework centres around <strong>three educational design principles</strong> (National Center on Universal Design for Learning, 2014):</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>1. <a href=""http://www.udlcenter.org/aboutudl/udlguidelines/principle1"">Provide multiple means of representation</a></strong></p>
                  
                  <p>This principle is based on the idea that learners will perceive and process information in different ways. Provide information in multiple modes (e.g. graphics, audio, text) to enable access for learners with certain disabilities or impairments. It also helps all learners to understand the information and make connections between different concepts.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>2. <a href=""http://www.udlcenter.org/aboutudl/udlguidelines/principle2"">Provide multiple means of action and expression</a></strong></p>
                  
                  <p>This principle is based on the idea that learners approach learning tasks differently and will act and express their ideas in different ways. Support learners to communicate their ideas through different means (e.g. through physical action, assistive technologies, text responses, dialogue, creative media), guide them to set goals and monitor their progress, and support them to plan and structure information.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>3. <a href=""http://www.udlcenter.org/aboutudl/udlguidelines/principle3"">Provide multiple means of engagement</a></strong></p>
                  
                  <p>This principle is based on the idea that learners will be engaged or motivated by different things. Provide options for personalising activities and assignments, improve engagement in activities, and demonstrate the cultural and social relevance of course concepts. Build motivation by providing feedback, setting goals, and giving rewards for completing tasks. Support learners to develop their self-regulatory skills, and provide opportunities for self-reflection.</p>
                  
                  <p>Now, take some time to review the <a href=""http://www.udlcenter.org/aboutudl/udlguidelines/"">UDL guidelines</a> on the National Center on UDL website read the checkpoints and examples.</p>

                  <p>Check out the <strong>Weekly Summary</strong> by Course Educators, on Monday 10th April, 2017.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""summary-and-reflection"">Summary and reflection</h3>
                  <p>With over 1200 learners in the course, there has been much discussion during the first week of the course. In this week we started by looking at what is design and some of the frameworks which influence course design in higher education</p>
                  
                  <p>It is wonderful to see so many learners from around the world including Suhail in Saudi Arabia, Ricardo in Mexico, Jenni in Canada and Negin in Adelaide. Using <a href=""https://padlet.com/UNSW/sfizek6on9mo"">Padlet</a> is a great tool to use for an icebreaker when starting a new course, even with a face-to-face class.</p>
                  
                  <p>Many of you shared <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/educational-design/1/steps/161130"">technologies</a> you have integrated in your courses to support learning. If you are unsure of what technology to use when, the <a href=""https://teachingtools.med.unsw.edu.au/"">UNSW Teaching Technology Toolkit</a> website includes a decision tree tool to assist teachers in choosing the right tool for the best learning.</p>
                  
                  <p>Nalini Pather&#8217;s recommendation on <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/educational-design/1/steps/157506#fl-comments"">designing a course</a> through incremental changes, resonated with many of you. Seeking student feedback as these changes are progressively made will also inform changes to the course.</p>
                  
                  <p>There was robust discussion around Angelo&#8217;s three rules for course design. Many of you agreed with the rules posed.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>What&#8217;s Next?</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>In <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/educational-design/1/todo/7010"">Week 2</a>, Models, methods and tools for educational design, we will explore blended and flipped classroom models and hear from UNSW academics of their own experiences. We will also consider the key to designing good assessment, and how it aligns to program and course learning outcomes.</p>

                  <p>Welcome to Week 2 of the course where we focus on how to develop well-aligned, well-structured programs and courses. We explore questions like:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>What do want your students to achieve when they complete the program, the course or your class?</li>
                    <li>How do you design learning outcomes for your courses?</li>
                    <li>How do you align the elements of your teaching program to ensure the quality of these programmes?</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>We look at what makes a good blended learning course and how flipping the classroom improves student&#8217;s deeper approach to learning.</p>
                  
                  <p>As this course, <strong>Introduction to Educational Design in Higher Education</strong>, is part of the FutureLearn Program, <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/programs/university-learning-and-teaching"">Foundations of Learning and Teaching</a>, you will find out how this course and it&#8217;s elements align to the many educational design models which are covered in this course. Check out the <strong>Mapping Time</strong> items in steps where we provide authentic examples.</p>
                  
                  <p>Don&#8217;t forget, that you are unsure about any aspects of the course, post your question in the <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/educational-design/1/steps/167911"">If you get stuck</a> step.</p>

                  <p>The intention of learning outcomes is to make it clear to the students what they, as learners, are expected to achieve as a result of having successfully completed the course.</p>
                  
                  <p>Learning outcomes describe the knowledge, skills and the application of the knowledge and skills a person has acquired and is able to demonstrate as a result of learning (AQF, 2013, p.97).</p>
                  
                  <p>Course Learning Outcomes (CLO) are nested within Program Learning Outcomes (PLO), as we explored in <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/educational-design/1/steps/166485"">Step 1.12</a>. Learning outcomes should <em>align</em> with the key course components of curriculum content, learning and teaching activities, and assessment.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""how-to-write-learning-outcomes"">How to write learning outcomes</h3>
                  
                  <p>Use these criteria as a guide when developing your learning outcomes. Good learning outcomes:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>represent the learning goals by starting with an action verb</li>
                    <li>are expressed clearly and easily understood</li>
                    <li>can be understood within the context of the discipline (eg: what is critical thinking within the faculty?)</li>
                    <li>indicate the kind of performance expected (either within the outcome or aligned to the criteria for assessment)</li>
                    <li>should be authentic to the level of learning (e.g. undergraduate versus postgraduate, 1st year course versus a 3rd year course)</li>
                    <li>be limited in number (ideally 4 to 6)</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>Here is a simple formula for writing learning outcomes:</p>

                  <p>Bloom&#8217;s digital taxonomy (Churches, 2007) can help you navigate through the myriad of technological tools and make choices based on the learning experiences we want students to engage in. This taxonomy aligns the choice of technology with the level of the intended learning outcomes for that course or lesson. You start by considering the learning outcome and then choose a tool that will support your students&#8217; growth toward reaching that learning outcome.

                  <p>SAMR is another model designed to help you integrate and use technology in your course. It is particularly useful when you are converting content or resources from a traditionally delivered course to a blended or flipped learning course. It is a four-level taxonomy categorised as:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Substitution:</strong> The technology provides a substitute for other learning activities without functional change.</li>
                    <li><strong>Augmentation:</strong> The technology provides a substitute for other learning activities but with functional improvements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Modification:</strong> The technology allows the learning activity to be redesigned.</li>
                    <li><strong>Redefinition:</strong> The technology allows for the creation of tasks that could not have been done without the use of the technology.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>Here is an example of how  the SAMR model is used to convert traditional word processed documents to Google documents.</p>
                  
                  <table>
                    <thead>
                      <tr>
                        <th><strong>Taxonomy</strong></th>
                        <th><strong>Definition</strong></th>
                        <th><strong>Example</strong></th>
                      </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                      <tr>
                        <td><strong>Substitution:</strong></td>
                        <td>The technology provides a substitute for other learning activities without functional change.</td>
                        <td>Using Google documents as a word processor only</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td><strong>Augmentation:</strong></td>
                        <td>The technology provides a substitute for other learning activities but with functional improvements.</td>
                        <td>The ability to share your Google document and it automatically saves to the Cloud is additional functionality</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td><strong>Modification:</strong></td>
                        <td>The technology allows the learning activity to be redesigned.</td>
                        <td>Students collaborating on the same Google document and using comment feature to provide feedback</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td><strong>Redefinition:</strong></td>
                        <td>The technology allows for the creation of tasks that could not have been done without the use of the technology.</td>
                        <td>Sharing your Google document with a cohort of students elsewhere in the world, use the chat,  comment feature or voice app to include comments and feedback. Finally sharing the document to a public website.</td>
                      </tr>
                    </tbody>
                  </table>
                  
                  <p>Good educational design acknowledges that while you may start with substitution, as a designer you would aim to also integrate technology at the higher levels of augmentation, modification and even redefinition. The challenge for educational design is to be &#8216;moving from enhancement to transformation&#8217; (Pentedura, 2013) to enhance student learning outcomes.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""padagogy-wheel"">Padagogy Wheel</h3>
                  
                  <p>The Padagogy Wheel brings together Bloom&#8217;s taxonomy, Bloom&#8217;s digital taxonomy, the SAMR model and more. (Carrington, 2015).</p>
                  
                  <p>As you can see this model centres around Graduate Capabilities in the course design. The underlying principle of the Padagogy Wheel, is that pedagogy should determine the educational choice and use of the technology tools. The five layers of the wheel move from graduate attributes and capabilities, Bloom&#8217;s taxonomy levels and associated verbs, technology enhancement activities and the SAMR model. The challenge is to make sure that good teaching practice drives the choice of technology.</p>
