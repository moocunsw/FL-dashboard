                  <p>In this program, you have the option to develop an ePortfolio to support your development as a reflective practitioner by collecting evidence from the course activities and discussions.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""purpose"">Purpose</h3>
                  <p>To help you develop connections between the program and your workplace.  To link theory to practice through discussion and analysis of key issues that interest you and your peers. Your portfolio will be used in two ways:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>record your general reflections about teaching and learning during the course (not for submission)</li>
                    <li>complete the required portfolio activities drawing on your experiences during the program and copy these into the ePortfolio submission template provided at the bottom of the page (for submission).</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p><strong>Reflective practice</strong>: this documentation of reflection related to your own practice is for personal purposes, not for direct submission. Maintaining a record of your reflections will provide the information you need to write up your final portfolio task.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Peer sharing</strong>: although you won&#8217;t be directly required to submit these personal reflections we suggest it would be useful to share them with a peer to gain insight into different perspectives.
                  We have provided a peer review activity at the end of the course for you to share one of your portfolio tasks with your peers.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Collecting evidence</strong>: to complete the FULT program you will be asked to submit artefacts from your FULT learning, so it will be useful to collect and keep a copy of these as part of your reflection.</p>
                  
                  <p>These include:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>quotes from your reflective writing, or from the posts that have been critical in prompting your thinking;</li>
                    <li>references to readings and research that have influenced you;</li>
                    <li>lesson plans you have developed;</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>write brief notes or point form phrases</li>
                    <li>observe others and describe what you learn from them</li>
                    <li>listen to what your peers/colleagues have to say about issues that you raise for discussion and use the different perspectives to deepen your personal reflection</li>
                    <li>ask yourself &#8216;what&#8217; &#8216;why&#8217; and &#8216;how&#8217; questions to discover why a situation you experienced or observed could be a valuable stimulus for reflection and learning.</li>

                  <p>Just as there are many terms to describe reflective practices (for example, your discipline may use critical thinking, evaluation, mindfulness, investigation, contemplation) there is no one definition of reflection. Here are two definitions:</p>
                  
                  <p><em>Deliberately thinking about action with a view to its improvement 
                  (Hatton &amp; Smith, 1995, p.34)</em></p>
                  
                  <p><em>Reflection is a deliberate and conscientious process that employs a person&#8217;s cognitive, emotional and somatic capacities to mindfully contemplate on past, present or future (intended or planned) actions in order to learn, better understand and potentially improve future actions. 
                  (Harvey, Coulson &amp; McMaugh, 2016, p.9)</em></p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""how-can-we-reflect"">How can we reflect?</h3>
                  <p>As with all learning, you can engage (with reflective practice) in a range of ways, from using a shallow approach (e.g., recalling, reporting or describing) through to a deep approach (e.g., synthesising, critiquing or transforming).  There are many ways to engage in reflective practice. It is important to find a mode of practice that suits your learning best.</p>
                  
                  <p>You can support your reflective practice by adopting different perspectives, or lenses. The four critically reflective lenses are:</p>

                  <p>We start this course by looking at student approaches to learning but first we would like to find out something about the students that you work with in your context.</p>
                  
                  <p>In an increasingly demand-driven system, we are seeing growing student participation in higher education. In Australia, for example, there has been an almost 70 per cent increase in student places between 2001 and 2014, from approximately 588,000 to more than 977,000 places (Universities Australia, 2015).</p>
                  
                  <p>The increase in student participation rates is also resulting in a corresponding increase in the diversity of the student cohort. Diversity can refer to cultural, ethnic, religious, social and economic background and to gender and orientation. Many universities have inclusivity programs and policies to support their diverse student bodies. As teachers and designers of good learning, we need to know our students so that we can design an inclusive learning experience to meet their learning needs.</p>

                  <p>There has been a lot of research into students&#8217; ideas  of, and approaches to, learning.  One approach is that students think about learning in six qualitatively different ways:</p>
                  
                  <ol>
                    <li>An increase in knowledge</li>

                    <li>Acquiring facts and procedures for later application and practice</li>
                    <li>The abstraction of meaning</li>
                    <li>An interpretive process to understand and see reality in a different way, and</li>

                  <p>There are many <a href=""http://hotel-project.eu/sites/default/files/Learning_Theory_v6_web/Learning%20Theory.html"">theories of learning</a> to help us better understand how students learn.</p>
                  
                  <p>The key theories and educational approaches used in this that frame this course are:</p>

                  <h3 id=""constructivism"">Constructivism</h3>
                  
                  <p>Constructivism is the process where  students <strong>learn by constructing knowledge and meaning from their experiences</strong>.</p>
                  
                  <p>This construction of knowledge:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>is based on previous understanding and experience,</li>
                    <li>may occur through interactions with others and</li>
                    <li>positions the learner at the centre of activity.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>In <strong>social constructivism</strong>, knowledge is constructed through interaction with others.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Optional activity</strong>:
                  To learn more about how students learn take a look at at Section 3, &#8220;Understanding&#8221;, of the <a href=""https://youtu.be/iMZA80XpP6Y?t=6m18s"">Teaching Teaching &amp; Understanding Understanding</a> video (6:18).</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""student-centred-learning"">Student-centred learning</h3>
                  <p>A basic principle of constructivism is that the student is at the centre of learning. The students&#8217; needs and interests are the starting point for learning and teaching activities. Students also have an active role and responsibility for learning and the teacher takes on  the role of facilitator.</p>
                  
                  <p>The principles of student-centred-learning include:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>The learner has full responsibility for their own learning</li>
                    <li>Subject matter must have relevance and meaning for the learner</li>
                    <li>Involvement and participation are necessary for learning</li>
                    <li>Relationship between learners is important</li>
                    <li>The teacher should be a facilitator and resource person</li>

"1.11","Surface, deep and strategic approaches to learning","Article","","","Week 1","2017-03-13","13 Mar","Week 1: Student approaches to learning","https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/learning-teaching-university/1/steps/148683","[<div class=""a-text-context a-text-context--bold-intro"">
                  <p>Good teachers understand learning, what it takes to learn, and how to encourage and support deep approaches to learning. Understanding the qualitatively different ways students interpret and undertake tasks has implications for the way we go about designing tasks and assessment.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""surface-and-deep-learners"">Surface and deep learners</h3>
                  <p>You may have observed students who complete the minimum tasks, memorise what is needed for an exam and nothing more. This is referred to as a surface approach (Marton and Salj&#246;, 1976a, 1976b) where students see learning tasks as enforced work. These students tend to be passive learners, working in isolation, and see learning as coping with tasks so they can  pass assessment. By contrast a student who adopts a deep approach to learning will seek to understand meaning. They have an intrinsic interest and enjoyment in carrying out the learning tasks, and have a genuine curiosity in the subject and connections with other subjects and with building on their current learning. These students may enjoy social learning, including discussing different points of view.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""strategic-learners"">Strategic learners</h3>
                  <p>Some students may use both deep and surface approaches to achieve their goals depending on what is required and the conditions under which they are learning such as how much time they have to prepare for an assessment. This is referred to as strategic (Entwistle &amp; Ramsden, 1982), or achieving (Biggs,1987) learning. Strategic learners use &#8216;cues and clues&#8217; (Ramsden, 1979) about assessment and are motivated by learning that results in positive outcomes such as the achievement of high grades.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""other-factors"">Other factors</h3>
                  <p>There are other factors which influence student learning including motivation, background, prior knowledge and experience, educational context and assessment to name a few (Biggs, 1996). You can probably think of many others.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Optional activity</strong>:
                  To learn more about how students approach their learning take a look at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMZA80XpP6Y&amp;t=35s"">section 1 Learning</a> in the Teaching Teaching &amp; Understanding Understanding video (0:35 - 5:00 minutes).</p>
                  
                  <p>You will need to think further about the shallow, deep and strategic approaches to learning in the next step.</p>

                  <p>Educational researchers have developed validated quizzes, inventories and questionnaires and each tool differs based on different learning theories. For example, you can have students complete a questionnaire so they can reflect on their results and develop a deeper understanding of their individual and preferred approach to learning.

                  <p>Today the focus has moved from what the teacher does in the learning context to what the student does and the relationship between learning and experience. This is based on extensive research into student learning in higher education.</p>
                  
                  <h2 id=""experiential-learning"">Experiential learning</h2>
                  <p>Experiential learning is as an ongoing process where experience is generated through our ongoing engagement with the world (Kolb,1984). Learning and experience can not be separated. Experiences shape and reshape our ideas as we progress through four stages:</p>
                  
                  <ol>
                    <li>Concrete experience</li>

                  <p>As students learn from experience they may engage in a process of trying to resolve the conflict between contradictory ideas. This is  &#8216;cognitive conflict&#8217; (Piaget, 1930) and &#8216;cognitive dissonance&#8217; (Festinger, 1957). Learning may therefore also involve the &#8216;unlearning.  of old habits and ways of thinking (Cochran-Smith, 2003, McWilliam, 2008).</p>
                  
                  <p>Not all students learn as effectively as each other from experience but as teachers we can create the conditions to make it more likely they will (Boud, Cohen &amp; Walker, 1993). We can support learners to challenge their assumptions and ideas and through this process develop new knowledge based on this exploration.</p>

                  <p>Throughout this first week we introduced you to some basic principles of student learning by drawing on your own experiences and the literature.</p>
                  
                  <p>In the discussions you shared your experiences of using <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/learning-teaching-university/1/steps/162686"">reflective practice</a> in your professional contexts and discussed how it can enable us to challenge our assumptions and reveal our biases.</p>
                  
                  <p>In the comments on <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/learning-teaching-university/1/steps/148669"">UNSW Beliefs about Learning</a> some of you challenged the validity of one or more beliefs whereas others found it difficult to identify any one belief that was less relevant than the others.
                  Clearly everyone has different <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/learning-teaching-university/1/steps/162696"">experiences of learning</a>, however, a common theme across the responses was that good experiences tended to reflect one or more of the beliefs about learning (or some variation of these).  For example, being engaged in learning (one way or another) was common as well having clear motivational goals for engagement in the activity. Negative experiences of learning were clearly passive and often inactive, or as many people said, &#8216;boring&#8217;.</p>
                  
                  <p>Many of you identified broader educational systems focussed around assessment, grading and benchmarking as the primary cause of <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/learning-teaching-university/1/steps/162696"">surface approaches to learning</a>. There were various responses to the survey for &#8216;typical&#8217; students however most &#8216;ideal&#8217; students were aligned with the characteristics of deep learners.  Many of you discussed how to encourage deep learning in practice. In the second course on educational design you&#8217;ll get the opportunity to think about the relationship between deep learning and course design.</p>
                  
                  <p>In Week 2 we&#8217;ll be focussing on teaching, in particular you&#8217;ll hear from teachers at UNSW discussing their approaches and strategies to teaching in their contexts.</p>

                  <p>Although there is no one right way to teach, there are strategies  and characteristics of good teaching  established over decades of research (for example: Chickering &amp; Gamson, 1987; Graham, et.al. 2001; Harfield, 1995; Prosser &amp; Trigwell, 2002; Ramsden, 2003). As you read through the list below think back to your answers in <em><a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/learning-teaching-university/1/steps/162696"">Step 1.9 Your experiences of learning</a></em> and compare the relationship between your ideas of good teaching (as a learner) and your practice as a teacher.</p>

Sitting in classes listening to teachers, memorising pre-packaged assignments, and completing online quizzes does not provide engaging opportunities for student learning.

                  <p>In contrast, the teacher may be alternatively be viewed as the authority who transmits knowledge and information to the learner (Kember &amp; Kwan, 2000). These teachers were more likely to be using content-centred approaches to teaching whereas the teachers who conceived of teaching as facilitation were more likely to use learner-centred approaches. The approach teachers take to teaching can therefore be described as on a continuum from a focus on content to a focus on the learner (Kember &amp; Kwan, 2000).</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Level 1 - What the student is</li>
                    <li>Level 2 - What the teacher does</li>
                    <li>Level 3 - What the student does</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>A teacher who focuses on what students do (level 3) is clear about the type of learning/teaching activities that are required to achieve the learning outcomes.</p>
                  
                  <p>This means the teacher needs to design appropriate strategies for this stage of student learning.</p>
                  
                  <p>To help inform your course and/or class design the table below outlines a five-stage learning model (Toohey, 1999).</p>

Once the learners have acquired the knowledge and skills described in the learning outcomes the next stage will likely involve using that knowledge and/or those skills.

                  <p>In this course we have already established there is no one &#8216;right&#8217; way to teach. This also applies to tutorials, there isn&#8217;t just one way to facilitate a tutorial.</p>
                  
                  <p>A tutorial or &#8220;tute&#8221; is a class configuration in which a small group of students interact to discuss the content of a previous lecture under the guidance of a tutor. Laboratory, fieldwork and workshop may also be used for small group learning.</p>
                  
                  <p>One of the main benefits of the tutorial is that it requires active participation from students. The tutorial learning context provides opportunities for students to engage more thoughtfully with the course concepts and discipline knowledge. Conversely the smaller group numbers in a tutorial can be potentially threatening to students who are not comfortable speaking to a group.</p>
                  
                  <p>In <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/learning-teaching-university/1/steps/161745"">step 2.4</a> we introduced you to a model of learning that you can use to help you plan your classes whether you are teaching in a lecture, a tutorial or a laboratory. Some of the strategies listed below can support you in setting up tutorials that encourage participation.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Be prepared</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>Think about your outcomes for the tutorial. Before you go into a tutorial be clear on what it is you want the students to do and what it is they need, that is, the aims and outcomes for the tutorial.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Get to know each other</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>Spend some time at the beginning of the first tutorial telling the students about yourself and asking them to find out about each other. &#8216;Ice-breakers&#8217; can be used in the first tutorials (refer to &#8216;Want to know more?&#8217;).</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Make your expectations clear</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>Talk to the students about your expectations of them in terms of contributing to the class and working together as a large group and also in small groups. Ask the students what they are expecting to get out of the tutorial. Together you could come up with a list of ground rules for the group.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Organise the physical environment</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>Think about the types of activities you want the students to be doing and organise the physical space to meet the needs of the group and maximise opportunities for learning.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Create an inclusive learning environment</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>In your tutorial groups students will come with a range of diverse backgrounds and experiences which can enrich the learning for all members of the group. As a tutor it is your responsibility to create an environment for learning that <a href=""https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/system/files/inclusivelearningandteaching_finalreport.pdf"">supports the diversity</a>, and is inclusive of all students.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Ask students for feedback</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>Give your students the opportunity to provide feedback on their experiences of the tutorials at some point during the semester so you can act on their suggestions. This can be as simple as anonymous feedback on post-it notes or short questionnaires in your institution&#8217;s learning management system.</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <h3 id=""talking-point"">Talking point</h3>

                    <p>Post one strategy that Tim has mentioned that you agree would be effective for creating a good tutorial.</p>

                  <p>In <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/learning-teaching-university/1/todo/7048"">week 1</a> of this course we looked at student approaches to learning and listened to teachers talking about student-centred approaches to teaching. A large majority of university teaching still takes place in traditional lecture spaces with large numbers of students, providing challenges for just how &#8216;active&#8217; students can be in their learning.</p>
                  
                  <p>Traditional lectures are mainly didactic and teacher-led. Lectures can be effective in presenting information, but not in changing students attitudes or in stimulating higher order thinking. Yet, students like &#8216;really good&#8217; lectures (Bligh, 1972 in Biggs &amp; Tang, 2011, p. 136).</p>
                  
                  <p>In this step we look at some strategies and resources that can help you develop &#8216;really good&#8217; lectures by implementing active learning.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Be prepared</strong><br/>
                  In <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/learning-teaching-university/1/steps/161769"">step 2.6</a> we talked about being prepared for tutorials but this is even more critical in lectures, particularly with large classes. Outline what you and the students will be doing during the class at the beginning. Make good use of signposts and transitions to highlight key concepts and help students to follow the direction that you are taking them.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Set your expectations on the first day</strong><br/>
                  Make your expectations clear to students the first time you meet, for example, that you want them to interact with you and their peers, and to ask questions.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Break up the &#8216;teacher talk&#8217; time</strong><br/>
                  Build group activities into the lecture time to break it into accessible chunks. If you stop after 15/20 minutes and ask students to work on a problem, talk about what they have just heard or write about it you are helping them process what they are learning. After these activities students are then ready to focus on the next &#8216;chunk&#8217; of material that you cover.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Ask questions that encourage participation</strong><br/>
                  If you ask a specific question to the whole group in a large lecture the reality is that very few students will be willing to volunteer an answer. If, however, you ask for a show of hands for those who think either way, for/against, high/low in response to a question students are far more likely to volunteer a response. This is a useful strategy with low stakes for shy students to get them involved on the first day. Try to avoid answering all the questions that come from student&#8217;s yourself, pose the questions back to the class or to smaller groups.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Use technology to encourage participation</strong><br/>
                  Incorporate tools like &#8216;clickers&#8217;, if you have access to them, or freely available online polling tools such as <a href=""https://www.polleverywhere.com/"">Poll Everywhere</a> or <a href=""https://www.socrative.com"">Socrative</a> to gauge understanding during the lecture.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Connect learning to the &#8216;real world&#8217;</strong><br/>
                  To encourage students to develop a deeper understanding of the concepts you want them to learn, use complex, real-world examples and draw on their experiences.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Ask for feedback</strong><br/>
                  In any learning and teaching context, whether in the lecture, tutorial, lab or online it is always better to ask your students for feedback during the course. Don&#8217;t wait until the end when the students won&#8217;t see the value for them in providing you with feedback.</p>

                  <p>This week you have thought about and discussed some basic principles for teaching and explored a variety of teaching strategies for teaching in different modes.</p>
                  
                  <p>It was interesting to see that in rating the characteristics of a good teacher many of you chose &#8216;share the love of the subject&#8216; as number 1 or 2 in your lists and noted that this was a characteristic of your favourite teachers. There were also strong relationships between the characteristics you chose and your &#8216;good&#8217; learning experiences mentioned in Week 1.</p>
                  
                  <p><a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/learning-teaching-university/1/steps/149842#fl-comments"">David Perkin&#8217;s</a> question about &#8216;What&#8217;s worth learning?&#8217; inspired some discussion about how much of what (content) we teach is a waste of time. There was quite a lot of agreement with the claim alongside some nice points made about &#8216;what&#8217; we teach being a vehicle for the development of &#8216;how&#8217; we teach students to learn and to think.</p>
                  
                  <p>In <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/learning-teaching-university/1/steps/161769#fl-comments"">Strategies for effective tutorials</a> Tim&#8217;s perspective on the role of the tutor as both learner and teacher sparked some discussion on how to find a balance in this approach. On the one hand some people mentioned wanting to create a safe space for students to learn and feel comfortable in making mistakes. While others pointed out that as the teacher is also responsible for evaluating assessments his/her role in the class needs to transparent to the students.</p>
                  
                  <p>There were several excellent teaching strategies for large classes posted in <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/learning-teaching-university/1/steps/164607#fl-comments"">Making lectures more effective and engaging</a> including bringing authentic examples into the class for small group discussion to build confidence in contributing to the larger group. Others mentioned peer to peer instruction, quick quizzes done individually and in pairs and educational technologies such as Poll Everywhere and the Echo360 Active Learning Platform.</p>
                  
                  <p>Thank you for taking the time to post thoughtful comments and share your experiences with others in the course.</p>
                  
                  <p>In the final week of the course we look at the complex topic of assessment and hear from some UNSW students talking about their experiences of assessment and feedback in their faculties.</p>

                  <p>In Week 3 of the course we focus on pedagogical issues in learning and teaching.</p>
                  
                  <p>We start with blended and online learning as different modes of teaching. No matter what mode of teaching is used, the teacher needs to make sure that assessment is well-designed as both assessment and feedback play a pivotal role in the curriculum and in supporting student learning. Therefore, this week we will also begin to investigate the issue of assessment, and related issues of feedback and academic integrity.</p>
                  
                  <p>Historically, teaching and learning have been conducted &#8216;in person&#8217;, in physical spaces and places where people would come together.  The activities of teaching and learning were physical. As technologies advanced, &#8216;distance education&#8217; emerged using such mediums as paper, post, radio, film, video and television.  Today, the Internet, computers, tablets and smartphones have enabled further developments in integrating technology into the teaching context and opening up new ways to facilitate teaching and learning.  Among other terminologies, &#8216;digital&#8217;, &#8216;online&#8217;, and &#8216;blended&#8217; learning have become useful and practical concepts for integrating technology to facilitate teaching and learning.</p>

                    <p>Consider a course that you have taught or studied.</p>
                  
                    <ul>
                      <li>What was the role of technology in the course?</li>
                      <li>How did technology help students to learn?</li>

                  <p>(Keep a record for your ePortfolio)</p>
                  
                  <p>As well as continuing to teach face-to-face teachers worldwide are engaging students online or in digital tasks for learning.  Increasingly, universities &#8216;blend&#8217; the face-to-face course with the online aspects of the course.  Teaching in these complex environments provides both opportunities and challenges for teachers and learners.</p>
                  
                  <p>Let&#8217;s explore what these terms mean.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""online-learning"">Online learning</h3>
                  <p>Online learning gives students access to their courses from a remote location. They can complete learning activities and assessments online that are equivalent to an on-campus course (UNSW, 2015).</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""digital-learning"">Digital learning</h3>
                  <p>Digital learning is any type of learning facilitated by technology or by instructional practice that makes effective use of technology. Digital learning occurs across all learning areas and domains. It covers the application of a wide spectrum of practices including: blended and virtual learning. (Education and Training,  2015).</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""blended-learning"">Blended learning</h3>
                  <p>Blended learning uses various combinations of traditional face-to-face learning experiences with online and mobile technologies. Blended learning can, but doesn&#8217;t have to, occur at the same time as face-to-face. These days many universities provide blended and online courses It is now one of  the most significant technological trends driving educational change in higher education institutions (Johnson, et al., 2016, p. 1).</p>
                  
                  <p>Blended learning can support student-centred approaches to learning. It  enables teachers to move material that would usually be covered in class into the online or mobile environment, sharing the responsibility for learning with the student. The online components and the face-to-face time need to be integrated so that the learning experience is connected in the two modes. This requires thoughtful course design to make best use of both contexts.</p>

                  <p>Good online learning depends, among other things, on good online teaching.</p>
                  
                  <p>In 2001, as online learning was gathering widespread acceptance, a team of experts comprised a report offering a list of competencies required for good online teaching (Goodyear, Salmon, Spector, Steeples, &amp; Tickner, 2001).  In contrast to face-to-face teaching, it was suggested that an online teacher requires competencies in technology, design, and online facilitation.</p>
                  
                  <p>Nowadays, learners have high expectations of technology in their courses (Sharpe &amp; Browne, 2015, p.12). To successfully engage with online and blended learning, learners need to be &#8216;digitally literate&#8217; and expect to be equipped &#8220;with the digital literacy skills necessary to be productive in a rapidly changing work environment&#8221; (Johnson, et al., 2016, p. 24). Seven elements of digital literacy have been identified (JISC, 2014).</p>

                  <p>Learners do not always learn what is taught. That is why the most important assessment does not happen at the end of learning, it happens during the learning, when there is still time to do something with the information. Formative assessment is an aspect of teaching that is underpinned by some basic principles (Wiliam, 2011).</p>
                  
                  <p>Since assessment is such an important aspect of quality education institutions will often have policy and/or procedure to inform and guide students and teachers. At UNSW the basic principles underlying good assessment practice are stated in the university&#8217;s policy document. They are:</p>
                  
                  <p>2.1. Assessment is designed to guide and enhance student learning. 
                  2.2. Student learning is assessed against learning outcomes and expected standards of performance. 
                  2.3. Assessment provides credible information on student achievement. 
                  2.4. Assessment is fair and provides all students an impartial opportunity to demonstrate their learning. 
                  2.5. Assessment develops students&#8217; abilities to evaluate their own and peer&#8217;s work.</p>
                  
                  <p>(UNSW, 2017)</p>
                  
                  <p>Let&#8217;s explore the first item above.  It acknowledges that assessment has a profound influence on student learning - prior to an assessment and subsequently. However, a student&#8217;s motivation and approach to learning is affected by the anticipated requirements of an assessment task and their perception of its value and demand is relative to other activities. Completing an assessment task does not usually promote learning although immediate assessment tasks within learning activities e.g. an online quiz interspersed within an online lecture, can enhance retention of learning.  The provision of timely and effective feedback after an assessment is essential for promoting further learning.</p>
                  
                  <p>In the second course on educational design you will be introduced to the idea of constructive alignment and the way it may be used to design effective assessment.  It is an important and necessary way to effectively assess.</p>
                  
                  <p>Assessment should be viewed as a learning opportunity for students. It helps them apply their knowledge, and exercise the skills you are teaching, as well as demonstrate the development of their capabilities. Ideally, assessment is embedded in all aspects of a course rather than something that just happens at the end.</p>
                  
                  <p>There are two types of assessment:</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""formative-assessment"">Formative assessment</h3>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>Provides constructive feedback to students on their learning, for example by identifying strengths and weaknesses in their understanding and/or performance.</li>
                    <li>Provides feedback to teachers about what students know and identifies misconceptions and difficulties students might be facing in their learning.</li>
                    <li>Encourages and motivates learning.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <h3 id=""summative-assessment"">Summative assessment</h3>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>Passes judgement on the standard of a student&#8217;s learning generally in terms of assigned marks and grades.</li>
                    <li>Typically relates to a final submission, where students demonstrate the achievement of their intended learning outcomes.</li>
                    <li>Has a role in credentialing students for degrees and professional practice.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>An assessment task is not intrinsically formative or summative.  All assessment depends on how the feedback from the assessment is used. Summative assessment can also perform a formative role if it provides substantial feedback to students, and guides them to improve their learning.</p>
                  
                  <p>Formative and summative assessment are sometimes also described as &#8216;assessment as learning&#8217; and &#8216;assessment of learning&#8217;. Feedback is introduced in the following steps.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""students-value"">Students value</h3>
                  
                  <p>In terms of assessment, students value</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>Clear expectations and transparency</li>
                    <li>Clear links between lectures, tutorials, content and assessment tasks</li>
                    <li>Timely and useful feedback</li>
                    <li>Authentic tasks</li>
                    <li>Autonomy &#8211; possibilities for negotiation
                  (James, McInnis &amp; Devlin, 2002)</li>

                  <p>Selecting the right type of assessment to include in your course depends on a number of factors such as the course learning outcomes, the student cohort, the program structure, your discipline and more.</p>

                      <li>Skim the list of assessment types that your co-learners have generated. Adopt one type of assessment from the list (that you do not normally use in your course) and propose how you could use it in your own discipline.</li>

                  <p>With higher educational institutions experiencing increased class sizes over the last few decades, opportunities to provide ongoing personalised high quality feedback have decreased. Moves to blended, online and flipped classroom modes of delivery are changing the types and methods by which feedback is given.</p>
                  
                  <p>In the previous step we looked at what students think about assessment.  In this step, we look at the closely related topic of feedback. Regardless of the mode, timely, effective feedback has one of the most powerful influences on a student&#8217;s learning and achievement (Hattie &amp; Timperley, 2007). Students value timely and useful feedback (James, McInnis &amp; Devlin, 2002). Both teachers and students have a responsibility for feedback. A central pillar of the <a href=""https://teaching.unsw.edu.au/unsw-scientia-educational-experience"">UNSW Scientia Education Model (SEM)</a> is feedback.</p>

                  <p>Good feedback supports learning when it:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>encourages students to think critically about their work and to reflect on what they need to do to improve (self-assessment)</li>
                    <li>promotes dialogue between staff and students</li>
                    <li>is timely and prompt &#8211; while it is clearly relevant;</li>
                    <li>is aligned to the purpose of the assignment and to criteria</li>
                    <li>clarifies what good performance is (goals, criteria, expected standards)</li>
                    <li>is clear and specific and in enough detail</li>
                    <li>delivers high quality information to students about their learning</li>
                    <li>focuses on mastery, not effort</li>
                    <li>encourages positive motivational beliefs and self-esteem</li>
                    <li>has a forward-facing focus, is consequential &#8211; aimed at progressing learning and improving future efforts</li>
                    <li>is efficient for staff, and</li>

                  <p>As students engage as active learners, and academics engage in teaching and research, we assume that everyone will act with academic integrity. This concept is closely aligned with assessment.</p>
                  
                  <p>In <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/learning-teaching-university/1/steps/164706"">Step 3.4</a> we looked at the role of summative assessment in:</p>

                  <h3 id=""what-is-academic-integrity"">What is academic integrity?</h3>
                  
                  <p>In the past decade, the higher education sector has moved away from the punitive and negative concepts of plagiarism, academic dishonesty, violations and misconduct, towards the concepts of conduct and academic integrity. In Australia academic integrity has become a high profile issue with  recent increases in cheating, the MyMaster scandal and fake diploma mills (Bretag, 2015) resulting in some universities revoking degrees.</p>
                  
                  <p>At UNSW (2016) academic integrity is described as</p>
                  
                  <p>&#8216;the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles. It is necessary for ethical scholarship and is the fundamental belief system within any university community and is highly valued at UNSW.&#8217;</p>
                  
                  <p>More broadly, the International Centre for Academic Integrity (ICAI) has defined academic integrity as</p>
                  
                  <p>&#8216;a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to six fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility, and courage.&#8217; (Fishman, 2014)</p>
                  
                  <p><em>Reflection point:</em></p>
                  
                  <p>Do the six values of academic integrity (Fishman, 2014) align with your conceptualisation of acting with academic integrity?</p>
                  
                  <p>Academic integrity is important as it is</p>
                  
                  <p>&#8216;&#8230;a fundamental component of success and growth in the classroom. It prepares students for personal and professional challenges as well as providing a blueprint for future fulfillment and success.&#8217; (ICAI, n.d.)</p>

                  <p>Most organisations will have codes, policies, procedures and guidelines related to academic integrity. You may discover that there are multiple related policies in your organisation. The example of UNSW illustrates the range of documents that may exist.</p>

                  <p>Peer review is important because it enables the process of evaluation in the learning process.  It is a familiar process for academics who are actively publishing research papers and applying for grants. It is also common practice as a tool to enhance the quality of teaching. For the purposes of peer review of teaching, we can include all activities that affect the students&#8217; learning experiences, for example, course design, learning resources, learning activities, assessment tasks, and the management of the learning environment.</p>
                  
                  <p>There are many different ways to do a peer review, from formal evaluation systems to casual reflective conversations with colleagues. It is helpful to answer these four key questions before you start a peer review process (Sachs &amp; Parsell, 2013).</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Why are you engaging in peer review and what is it that you want to achieve?</strong></p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>You want help with a particular issue or challenge in your teaching</li>
                    <li>You want feedback to identify issues that are unknown to you</li>
                    <li>You want to engage with your colleagues in discussions about teaching</li>
                    <li>You want to get promoted</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p><strong>What aspect of teaching is to be the focus of your peer review?</strong> </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>Face-to-face classroom teaching in lectures, tutorials, workshops or laboratories</li>
                    <li>Teaching in an online learning environment</li>
                    <li>Components of teaching such as teaching materials, assessment tasks, marking, etc.</li>

                  <p><strong>Who will be the reviewer?</strong> </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>Should it be someone in your discipline?</li>
                    <li>Should it be someone at your level of appointment? </li>
                    <li>Should it be someone who has similar teaching practices to you?</li>
                    <li>Should it be a good friend?</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p><strong>How will the actual process of review take place?</strong> </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>What is the expected degree of formality?</li>
                    <li>What is the reviewer is expected to do?</li>

                  <p>The SOLO (Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome) taxonomy illustrated in figure 1 (originally Biggs &amp; Collis, 1982) can be used to categorise student responses to open-ended questions. The <a href=""https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/files/ea/57/ea57852a-d368-433f-9bfc-deeed51028e0/FULT_ePortfolio_marking_rubric_FINAL.pdf"">rubric</a> used to assess your ePortfolio is based on the SOLO taxonomy.</p>
                  
                  <p>SOLO illustrates the qualitative differences between student responses as it describes levels of understanding. It classifies outcomes in terms of their complexity, so that a judgement may be made on the quality of student responses to assessment tasks.</p>
                  
                  <p>The SOLO taxonomy classifies understanding into five (5) levels:</p>
                  
                  <ol>
                    <li>Prestructural: at this level the learner is missing the point</li>
                    <li>Unistructural: a response based on a single point.</li>
                    <li>Multistructural: a response with multiple unrelated points.</li>
                    <li>Relational: points presented in a logically related answer.</li>
                    <li>Extended abstract: demonstrating an abstract and deep understanding through unexpected extension.</li>
                  </ol>

                  &#8220;At first we pick up only one or few aspects of the task (unistructural), then several aspects but they are unrelated (multistructural), then we learn how to integrate them into a whole (relational), and finally, we are able to generalise that whole to as yet, untaught applications (extended abstract)&#8221;.</p>

                  <p>In this week of the course we looked at issues in learning and teaching with a focus on assessment. In the discussions on blended learning there was quite a variation in your experiences of this mode of learning and teaching but one common theme was how rapidly blended learning is growing. At UNSW the institutional focus on blended learning really began in 2013.</p>
                  
                  <p>Thank you to all those that shared links to technologies and resources and described examples of how they use technology in their teaching in <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/learning-teaching-university/1/steps/163349#fl-comments"">Step 3.2</a>. One of the themes in the discussions on blended learning <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/learning-teaching-university/1/steps/163384#fl-comments"">Step 3.3</a>  picked up on the examples of curating resources and teaching materials that were discussed by some of the UNSW teachers in the video. Some of you shared your own examples of pre-class activities and offered strategies for getting students to come to class prepared.</p>
                  
                  <p>In <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/learning-teaching-university/1/steps/164706#fl-comments"">Step 3.4</a> some of the assessments that people proposed to try out in their own discipline were peer feedback, presentations, simulation, group projects and scenario-based role play. A few people talked about the value of continual assessment for engaging and motivating students. Many of you talked about  the role of formative assessment in providing students with feedback on their progress during the course. This picks up on the comments from students in <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/learning-teaching-university/1/steps/168676#fl-comments"">Step 3.8</a> about feedback needing to be timely, relevant and regular.</p>
                  
                  <p>At the end of the Week 3 we invite you to share Activity (1b) from your ePortfolio with others in <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/learning-teaching-university/1/assignments/167570/submission/new"">Step 3.12</a>. We encourage you to take this opportunity to provide feedback to each other that is supportive and developmental.</p>
                  
                  <p>Thank you for all your wonderful participation in this first course in the <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/programs/university-learning-and-teaching"">Foundations of University Learning and Teaching program</a>. We look forward to seeing you in the next course, <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/educational-design"">Introduction to Educational Design in Higher Education</a>.</p>
