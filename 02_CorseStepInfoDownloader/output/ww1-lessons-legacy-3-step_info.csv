                  <p>Holger H. Herwig</p>
                  
                  <p>Germany and Austria-Hungary had been in an alliance since 1879. Despite this long relationship, the generals of both armies kept their military plans secret from each other until 1908-09, when Helmuth von Moltke the Younger became Chief of the German General Staff, and Conrad von H&#246;ltzendorf took the equivalent position in Vienna. These men had a cordial relationship, but neither would make firm commitments to the other about what would occur in the event of a war with Russia and France.</p>
                  
                  <p>Von H&#246;ltzendorfdid had not made adequate plans on how the Austro-Hungarian Army would be deployed at the beginning of a war with Russia while the bulk of the German Army was fighting France in the west. Herwig described the situation in 1914 as a &#8216;state of virtual non-planning&#8217; where Germany and Austria-Hungary were &#8216;woefully unprepared to conduct coordinated operations&#8217;.</p>
                  
                  <p>In 1915, the massive Austro-Hungarian losses against the Russians on the Eastern Front, made clear Austria-Hungary&#8217;s inferior position to Germany in the alliance. German generals were put in charge of operations. German officers and sergeants were placed in Austro-Hungarian units to improve their efficiency and discipline. German weapons and equipment were required to keep Austro-Hungarian units in the field.</p>
                  
                  <p>When Kaiser Franz Josef died in November 1916, his successor Karl attempted to negotiate a separate peace between the Austria-Hungary and the Allies. Peace was the best option for Austria-Hungary in 1917, but the alliance with Germany made this impossible. When the peace discussions were made public in 1918, Kaiser Karl was summoned to Germany and forced to sign agreements binding Austria-Hungary to Germany. Karl lost the opportunity to reform Austria-Hungary in ways which may have ensured its survival. Instead its fortunes were shackled to Germany, with the end of the war, the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed and ceased to exist.</p>

                  <p>Ian M. Brown</p>
                  
                  <p>The British Army was a small volunteer army, much smaller than its German and French counterparts, but, because of the size of the British Empire, the army had to be capable of deploying across the globe. For this reason, the British Field Service Regulations provided a clear division between the generals commanding the troops and the administrative officers who supplied the troops, and gave the administrative officers the ability, as one British general put it, to create &#8216;a system that was sufficiently elastic to meet practically the requirement of every possible theatre of operations&#8217;.</p>
                  
                  <p>The scale of fighting on the Western Front did provide the British with major difficulties. The deployment of the Indian Corps to France meant the provision of several different types of rations to match the dietary requirements of Hindu, Muslim and Sikh soldiers. Further complications arose because the Indians were partially supplied from Britain via the Channel ports and from India via Marseilles on the Mediterranean.</p>
                  
                  <p>At the First Battle of Ypres in 1914, the transportation of ammunition to the troops was made difficult as the Belgian, French and British supply lines became entangled. During 1915 the British Army regularly ran short of artillery shells, especially those for the heavy 4.5 inch howitzers and 60-pounder guns. Sir John French, the Commander-in-Chief, BEF, was forced to halt both the Battles of Festubert and Aubers Ridge in May 1915 due to lack of ammunition.</p>
                  
                  <p>Over time most of the supply problems were overcome. The increased shipping required to support around 750,000 troops and 250,000 horses was provided by establishing two parallel supply lines: the Southern Line through Le Havre and Rouen and the Northern Line through Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk.</p>
                  
                  <p>In July 1915 the Director of Supplies began providing British infantry divisions with a standard &#8216;divisional pack&#8217; that would provide the division with the daily supplies it required. The shortage of trained logistics officers was remedied by putting civilians with experience in railways and major retail or shipping companies into uniform, and, as Brown puts it, using them &#8216;in essentially in the same roles in France as they had filled with their firms in Britain&#8217;.</p>
                  
                  <p>The British Army&#8217;s victory over the German Army in 1918 was only possible because the soldiers were continually and consistently supplied.  As Brown points out, the credit for this must go the men who worked on the lines of communication in their unglamorous but vitally important role in the war.</p>

                  <p>Elizabeth Greenhalgh</p>
                  
                  <p>The British and the French had been rivals and enemies for hundreds of years. Starting with the Norman invasion of England in 1066, the animosity of these two rivals included; Hundred Years&#8217; War (1337-1453),  Napoleonic Wars (1792-1815), Lord Nelson&#8217;s victory over the French at Trafalgar (1805), the Duke of Wellington&#8217;s victory at Waterloo (1815), the stand-off  between Colonel Marchand and Lord Kitchener at Fashoda on the River Nile in Sudan (1898), and British opposition to constructing a Channel tunnel (1907). The French saw the British as being &#8216;Germanic&#8217;, greedy and arrogant; the British saw the French as being &#8216;Latin&#8217;, emotional and unreliable.</p>
                  
                  <p>It was Germany&#8217;s increasingly aggressive policies in the early 1900s that brought the two nations together. In 1904, France and Britain settled their colonial disputes with the agreement known as the <em>Entente Cordiale</em>. The two countries began joint military discussions that led to agreements that, in the case of war with Germany, the French Navy would take responsibility for the Mediterranean Sea, the Royal Navy for the Atlantic and the North Sea, and the British Army would provide a small expeditionary force to serve beside the French Army.</p>
                  
                  <p>During the war French political and military leaders argued that France was doing more fighting and suffering more casualties than the British. Greenhalgh accepts there was some truth in this; in the first six months of the war, the French Army had over three-quarters of a million soldiers killed, while the British in this period had only a few divisions on the Western Front. Also, the German occupation of northern France meant the loss of over half of French iron and steel production.</p>
                  
                  <p>The French accused the British &#8211; whose economy had not suffered from enemy invasion and occupation &#8211; of using the war to gain economic advantage. Greenhalgh points out that the French never fully understood the British contribution to the alliance at sea. British ships escorted convoys of merchant ships to protect them from German submarine attack and ensured vital goods reached France. The British and the French were the chief partners in the alliance that defeated Germany, but, as Greenhalgh concludes, there was &#8216;no solution to the conflict&#8217; between these two nations on how the war should be conducted and how the sacrifices of war should be shared.</p>

                  <p>The idea of the First World War as a futile and pointless war seems to have come from a viewpoint that the end result in no way justified the huge loss of life.</p>
                  
                  <p>However, European governments did not become involved in the war by accident, but through real commitment to underlying principles of loyalty to allies, the defence of small nations, as well as the opportunistic idea that a war at this time would be to one&#8217;s advantage.</p>
                  
                  <p>These factors drove the strategies of the major powers.
                  Germany supported its ally Austria-Hungary in its declaration of war with Serbia. They believed this would remove the threat to the multi-ethnic Austro-Hungarian state from rising Slav nationalism.  As Russia saw itself as the protector of Serbia, the Germans recognised that supporting Austria-Hungary against Serbia would likely lead to war with Russia. 
                  The German Government believed war with Russia was inevitable, and that it was better to take the opportunity to fight the war sooner rather than later. Russian economic growth and the modernisation of the Russian army would, over time, make it a more formidable enemy.</p>
                  
                  <p>France became part of the war because Germany declared war on it on 3 August 1914. However, French President Raymond Poincar&#233; visited Russia on 20-23 July, and we still do not know whether Poincar&#233; encouraged his Russian allies to start mobilising their army.</p>
                  
                  <p>The United Kingdom had no formal alliance with any European power, but the British Government had held secret military talks with France which did include plans for a small British Expeditionary Force to go to France in the event of a war with Germany.</p>
                  
                  <p>When Germany invaded Belgium on 4 August, the UK declared war on Germany. Prime Minister Herbert Asquith wrote in a letter on 2 August that his government did &#8216;have obligations to Belgium&#8217;, referring to the Treaty of London which made Belgium a neutral country, but also stated that he &#8216;cannot allow Germany&#8217; to have naval bases on the Belgian coastline as they would threaten Britain. The British declaration of war was therefore a combination of national self- interest and defending the right of Belgium to exist. The second - and more noble - cause, would be important in mobilising British public support for the war.</p>
                  
                  <p><em>What alternative to going to war could have been realistic for the participants in the First World War in 1914?</em></p>

                  <p>As we have seen in the previous two videos, 1916 was a period of heavy casualties for the main armies on the Western Front with few decisive results. The two principal battles fought in 1916 were the Battle of Verdun and the Battle of the Somme.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Battle of Verdun:</strong> Fought from 21 February&#8211;15 December 1916. A German attack with the aim of inflicting so many casualties on the French Army it would be forced to end the war. The French lost 156,000 men (dead or missing) but German losses were almost as high and Verdun remained in French hands.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Battle of the Somme: </strong>Fought from 1 July&#8211;18 November 1916. The primary aim was for the Allies to push the Germans to their limits on all fronts (West, East and Italian), which the Germans would be forced to defend. On the opening day of the Somme Battles, 1 July 1916, around 60,000 British men became casualties, with approximately 20,000 dead.</p>

                  <p>Robert A. Doughty</p>
                  
                  <p>In April 1917, General Robert Nivelle, the new commander of the French Army, ordered a large offensive against the Germans at Chemin des Dames in northern France. When this offensive cost many lives and did not capture any ground, the army&#8217;s morale collapsed. About 30,000 soldiers in 54 French infantry divisions engaged in &#8216;collective acts of indiscipline&#8217; that many historians have described as &#8216;protests&#8217;. Doughty argues these should be seen as mutiny that did have a political dimension such as demanding an immediate end to the war.</p>
                  
                  <p>The Germans were aware of the mutinies, and in June and July 1917 made several attacks at Chemin des Dames where the French soldiers&#8217; disaffection was strongest. The German offensives failed: the French soldiers were unwilling to take place in pointless attacks, but they fought to stop any German advance.</p>
                  
                  <p>Nivelle was sacked and replaced by General Philippe P&#233;tain, who restored the French Army. P&#233;tain improved soldier&#8217;s living conditions, their access to leave, their training and equipment. With the support of French President Raymond Poincar&#233;, and War Minister Paul Painlev&#233;, P&#233;tain had a small number of the mutineers tried and punished, but the number of soldiers executed was small: around fifty or less. P&#233;tain promised the soldiers that he would not throw their lives away for no purpose.</p>
                  
                  <p>In May the unified French political support for the war &#8211; the Union Sacr&#233;e or Sacred Union &#8211; was broken when President of the Council of Ministers (equivalent to prime minister) Alexandre Ribot refused to grant passports to some socialist members of the French Chamber of Deputies who wanted to attend an international socialist conference in Stockholm in neutral Sweden. The socialists withdrew their support for the government, forcing Ribot to resign, and thousands of workers went on strike. It is true that most French socialists in 1917 wanted peace, but they did not want a French defeat.</p>
                  
                  <p>During 1917, French politicians had considered options for a negotiated peace with Germany. In November President Poincar&#233; chose George Clemenceau to be President of the Council of Ministers. Clemenceau had been a strong supporter of the war and a strong critic of the French political leadership.

                  <p>Robin Prior &amp; Trevor Wilson</p>
                  
                  <p>To conclude our overview of the First World War the reading from Robin Prior and Trevor Wilson examines why the Allies defeated Germany in 1918.</p>
                  
                  <p>These two historians concentrate on two factors: the first is the series of poor decisions made by Erich Ludendorff and other German generals, the second is the British Army&#8217;s military effectiveness in the final year of the war.</p>
                  
                  <p>Prior and Wilson point out that the series of German offensives on the Western Front from March to June 1918 did display innovation in artillery and infantry tactics. Ludendorff ensured that the Germans had at least three times more artillery than the Allies on a particular sector at the beginning of an attack. The German bombardment shocked the defenders and enabled the German infantry to break through the Allied lines. Specially trained assault soldiers &#8211; known as stormtroopers &#8211; led the attack and initially made rapid advances.</p>
                  
                  <p>In all cases, however, the German thrust was slowed and then stalled. Once the storm troopers advanced beyond on the range of the German artillery, they were reliant on the weapons they were carrying to continue their advance, while the defending Allied troops always had artillery to support them. The stormtroopers suffered heavy casualties, but they could not be easily replaced. The rest of the German infantry in 1918 were not as fit, not as well-trained, and not as well-equipped.</p>
                  
                  <p>The second error in German strategy that Prior and Wilson identify is Ludendorff&#8217;s decision to keep one million soldiers in the east when they would have been of greater use on the Western Front. The Germans had imposed a peace treaty on the new Russian communist government in March 1918 in which Finland, Poland, Ukraine and the Baltic regions of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania came under German control. In the last months of the war German soldiers in the east were advancing in Ukraine and Crimea. Ludendorff was making plans to capture Baku on the Caspian Sea and access its oil production. Prior and Wilson write that Ludendorff&#8217;s &#8216;determination to achieve expansion in the east&#8217; meant that &#8216;he carried through his policy to the detriment of the war in the west&#8217;.</p>
                  
                  <p>Prior and Wilson&#8217;s second factor for explaining the defeat of Germany in 1918 is that the British Army learned how to make successful and sustained advances on the Western Front. The authors use the term &#8216;weapon-system&#8217; to describe the number of methods that were developed to protect the infantry in the attack. These included: accurate artillery fire made possible by technical developments, regular weather reports and sound ranging to identify the location of German artillery batteries; machine guns, mortars and rifle grenades carried by the infantry; and tanks.</p>
                  
                  <p>Most importantly, Prior and Wilson argue that the British succeeded because of the &#8216;modesty of their ambitions&#8217;. In 1918 the British conducted limited attacks that &#8216;did not attempt to push the infantry beyond the limits of the technology&#8217;. This contrasts with the failed German strategy that, as the authors put it, combined &#8216;overweening arrogance&#8230; with ruthless expansionism and the desire to dominate&#8217;.</p>

                  <p>In 1914, the majority of men and women in the European countries that entered the conflict supported the war. The idea that there was &#8216;war enthusiasm&#8217; in 1914 is a myth &#8211; people knew that war inevitably produced death and destruction and the public response was generally low key, but it seems that most people believed their leaders had done the right thing in going to war.</p>
                  
                  <p>The French people, from the radicals of the left to the conservatives of the right, came together in the <em>Union Sacr&#233;e</em> &#8211; &#8216;sacred union&#8217;. The same thing happened in Germany, where the political truce was called  <em>Burgfriedenspolitik</em>, a reference to how the people living in a besieged castle in the Middle Ages would settle their differences to fight the common enemy.</p>
                  
                  <p>There was some opposition to the war: socialists across Europe hoped working class solidarity would be stronger than nationalism, and pacifists decried violence, but they were clearly in the minority.</p>
                  
                  <p>There were attempts to end the war by negotiation, especially in late 1916 and 1917, but these went nowhere because Germany refused any peace settlement that allowed Belgium to regain its independence.</p>
                  
                  <p>&#8216;War weariness&#8217; grew as the numbers of dead mounted, shortages increased, and it appeared as if the war would never end.</p>
                  
                  <p>Nonetheless, all the main European powers &#8211; with the exception of Russia, which left the war in 1917 &#8211; continued to fight until November 1918.</p>
                  
                  <p>The puzzle for us is to understand why people in the First World War acted as they did.</p>
                  
                  <p><em>Why were there relatively few protests against the war?</em></p>
                  
                  <p><em>Why did attempts to end the war by negotiation not succeed?</em></p>
                  
                  <p><em>Why did most people in most combatant nations continue to support the war for so long?</em></p>

                  <p>Ian M. Brown</p>
                  
                  <p>In this article Ian Brown examines the changing debate over the First World War.  He introduces the &#8220;Germanophile&#8221; and &#8220;Commonwealth&#8221; schools of thought, their lineage, and their attraction to readers.  Brown favors the philosophies of the Commonwealth school advocating that it presents a balanced view of the British Expeditionary Forces (BEF).  According to Brown, the BEF made tremendous strides during the war in the fields of tactical and operational methods which resulted in an offensive force that, in the summer of 1918, proved unstoppable.</p>
                  
                  <p>Despite these observations Brown notes that the weakness of all of the schools of thought on the First World War has been in the examination of administration and logistics.</p>
                  
                  <p>Brown examines the BEF&#8217;s opening of the &#8220;hundred days&#8221; campaign in August 1918 at Amiens as a supporting example. In particular, Brown looks at the operation of the Channel Ports, railway networks, and internal communications, using the &#8220;Michael Offensive&#8221; and Amiens as examples. According to Brown, the BEF learned some hard logistic lessons during the &#8220;Michael Offensive&#8221;, such as when dealing with internal communication.</p>
                  
                  <p>In summary, Brown advocates that a greater awareness of logistics is vital to understanding the course of the final year of the Great War.</p>

                  <p><em>&#8216;Above our heads the air is full of menace, howling, whistling and hissing.&#8217;</em><br/>
                  Erich Maria Remarque, <em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em>, p. 41</p>
                  
                  <p>Trench Warfare was an unprecedented form of warfare: soldiers had to advance in the face of large-scale artillery bombardments, deadly poison gas, barbed wire entanglements and machine gun fire.</p>
                  
                  <p>In the winters of 1916 and 1917, continual artillery bombardment and heavy rain combined to turn the plains of Northern France and Belgium into seas of mud.</p>
                  
                  <p>Most of the difficulties were with the attackers; most of the advantages were with the defenders.</p>
                  
                  <p>The 1916 battles of Verdun and the Somme clearly demonstrate this: when the German, French or British armies tried to attack, they all made little gain and all suffered heavy losses.</p>
                  
                  <p>Is this a key to our mystery? In the English-speaking world, is the memory of the losses on the Somme and at Passchendaele so powerful that it blots out the memories of the victories of 1918? Is this how the memory of the futile war is created? Or are there other factors involved?</p>
                  
                  <p><em>What effect does trench warfare have on soldiers? Why do most soldiers continue to fight in such circumstances?</em></p>
                  
                  <p><em>What alternatives do the Germans, French and the British have to fighting on the Western Front?</em></p>
                  
                  <p><em>What can these armies learn to do in order to break out of the stalemate of trench warfare?</em></p>

                  <p>Gary Sheffield</p>
                  
                  <p>Sheffield begins by noting that the 60 active divisions of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), under the command of Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig in November 1918, were primarily British (all but ten).  However, with a couple of exceptions, the activities of many British troops have received scant attention.  Sheffield argues that the historiography of the BEF&#8217;s participation in the Great War, with the exception of the volumes of the official British history, lack balanced accounts of the British forces.  He notes that texts continue to be published which contain unwarranted criticisms of the performance of British troops in 1918.</p>
                  
                  <p>Issues examined by Sheffield include the changing scope of the British Army from 1914 to 1918; organisational change; the heavy casualties of 1918; the weakness of the British divisions compared to the Canadian Corps and the New Zealand Division; and the fighting performance of British Divisions.  In support of the BEF, Sheffield notes that successful operations by British units greatly outnumbered failures, a fact that attests to the high level of competence to be found in the BEF.  Sheffield explores the range of aspects of British military performance in 1918 that were vital to the Allied cause, such as the BEF&#8217;s handling of supply and administration, noting that the demands on combat support and logistic units in 1918 were very different from those of trench warfare.</p>
                  
                  <p>Sheffield highlights that by the last year of the war, the British officer corps was a broadly meritocratic body, noting however, the severe strain under which the BEF&#8217;s command and control system was placed from March to July 1918.  Sheffield advocates that the performance of the British troops was a vital factor in the Allied victory of 1918.  According to Sheffield, it was undoubtedly a triumph for the British Empire, noting that it does not diminish the achievements of the Australian, Canadian, New Zealand and South African forces in any way to recognise that the performance of troops from the British Isles was an indispensable factor in the final victory.</p>

                  <p>Robert T. Foley</p>
                  
                  <p>Robert Foley divides Germany&#8217;s effort in the First World war  into two phases: the offensives in 1914, 1916 and 1918; and the &#8220;decisive&#8221; phase of 1917.</p>
                  
                  <p>He covers the formation of the Third &#8220;Obesrste Heeresleitung&#8221; (OHL) on 29 August 1916; and the instrumental roles of the new commanders Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and Generalleutnant Erich Ludendorff.  Foley assesses the observations of Hindenburg and Ludendorff, specifically manpower shortages and serious shortfalls in munitions on the Western Front or Westheer.</p>
                  
                  <p>Foley discusses the manner in which these problems were dealt with by Hindenburg and Ludendorff including the creation of army &#8220;groups&#8221;, organisational reform, distribution of reserves of manpower and munitions; and a new industrial program called the &#8220;Hindenburg Program&#8221;.  This industrial plan doubled munitions and trench mortar production, and tripled artillery and machine gun production.</p>
                  
                  <p>These responses intensified the battle during 1917 between the German army and industry over available manpower.  Foley considers the various ways that Ludendorff had hoped to address the German structural deficiencies in manpower including a heavier reliance on munitions and heavy weapons.  Technology was to take the place of numbers of troops and add to the combat power of German divisions.  However, as Foley notes this &#8220;rearmament&#8221; program, and large demand for weapons, was problematic as continuous shortages of raw materials meant that the ambitious munition production targets could not always be met.</p>
                  
                  <p>Foley examines other &#8220;new&#8221; tactical ideas of the Germans, such as Ludendorff&#8217;s plans to alter the way in which the German Army thought about warfare, in particular trench warfare. These new ideas were not readily accepted by all within the German army, with Ludendorff being challenged by various senior officers opposed to different aspects of the new doctrine, such as Oberst Fritz von Lossberg.  Foley also explains how Ludendorff looked for ways in which more divisions could be made available for a decisive offensive on the Western Front, which included freeing up troops from other fronts.</p>
                  
                  <p>According to Foley, the effectiveness of the new German defensive system was apparent, and he offers proof of the validity of the new doctrine.  Foley also examines the difficulties faced by the Germans due to changes in British tactics, and the subsequent major reconsideration of German tactical doctrine.  Other issues such as shortages brought on by congestion on the railways behind the Fourth Army are also highlighted.</p>
                  
                  <p>In summary, Foley proposes that the Hindenburg program, which was designed to shift the burden of fighting onto machines rather than men, had limited successes.  Rather, Foley highlights that the new doctrine allowed the Westheer to emerge victorious in its defensive battle against a superior enemy, and set the stage for a tactically successful offensive in the first half of 1918.</p>
                  
                  <p>Foley writes of the conscription of the &#8220;1899&#8221; group of young men (18 years old) . You might like to discuss the difficulties faced by the German Army in maintaining it&#8217;s manpower requirements during 1917 and 1918.</p>

                  <p>Andrew Weist</p>
                  
                  <p>In this article Andrew Weist contends that the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) went to battle unprepared and suffered because they believed they had nothing to learn from the mistakes of their Allies.  Although the European Allies offered the Americans training, logistical and doctrinal support, the AEF led by its commander, General John Pershing, remained stubbornly independent, and chose instead to learn the costly lessons of war through brutal experience</p>
                  
                  <p>Weist argues Americans had a deeply engrained cultural aversion to &#8220;European&#8221; styles of conflict. Americans believed they had a martial culture and they rejected &#8220;European-ness.&#8221;  Despite this cultural inflexibility, most evident on the tactical level, Weist points out that the AEF was able to overcome the vaunted Germans during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive of 1918&#8217;.  Weist notes that their combat participation in the war was &#8220;lightning-fast, lasting for a total of six months.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p>Tactically, the AEF downplayed the use of firepower as the method by which to overcome enemy entrenchments, in favour of tactics of open warfare, and the dominance of morale, the rifle and the bayonet.  Weist&#8217;s survey of the doctrinal journals, and the official doctrines of the American military of the time, also indicates the American tendency to reject the tactical lesson of the Great War, for example, the Infantry Journal, and the US Army&#8217;s Infantry Drill Regulations of 1917.</p>
                  
                  <p>Additionally Weist assesses the issue of training for the AEF, their reliance on the experienced British and French officers, the AEF&#8217;s chaotic training schedule, and examples of the weaknesses of the US training system.  Using the 32nd Division under the command of General William Haan, and the performance of the 1st and 2nd Divisions in the Second Battle of the Marne as examples, Weist concludes that the Americans went to battle unprepared, but instead of learning from the mistakes of their Allies, they preferred to learn from their experience.</p>

                  <p>During 1917 we see changes in how the battles on the Western Front are fought.</p>
                  
                  <p>At Messines, a complex British artillery bombardment provided a shield for the soldiers as they advanced and enabled them to capture ground from the Germans and hold it.</p>
                  
                  <p>At Cambrai, British tanks used their guns and machine guns to support the advance of the infantry. Also at Cambrai, the Germans replied to the British advance with a counter-attack by specially-trained storm troopers. The Germans regained most of the ground they had lost.</p>
                  
                  <p>The stalemate of trench warfare that had existed on the Western Front since the end of 1914 was being replaced at the end of 1917 with more free-flowing battles.</p>
                  
                  <p>With the German offensive of March 1918, trench warfare would be no more, and there would be a war of movement until the conflict ended.</p>
                  
                  <p>This <a href=""http://www.monatlas.fr/Hist/guerre14_18/ngun13.html"">map</a> shows the location of the counter offensives on the Western Front during 1918.</p>
                  
                  <p>The mystery here is how did this happen? What is clear is that there is no one single reason for the end of trench warfare.</p>
                  
                  <p>There were many innovations and changes, some large, but many small, that contributed to the return to mobile warfare in the final year of the war.</p>
                  
                  <p>How did these diverse developments come about? Who instigated them? Were they civilians or were they military? What were the problems they faced and how did they solve them?</p>
                  
                  <p><em>Choose one of the changes that led to the end of trench warfare and explain why it is important</em>.</p>
                  
                  <p>You may also like to discuss <em>why the mobile battles of 1918 like Amiens have been forgotten yet the Somme and Passchendaele  are the foundations of the popular memory of the war in the English-speaking world.</em></p>

                  <p>This week we had quite a lot of reading showing the many divergent factors involved in warfare. We also discussed the way  the war came to its end on 11 November 1918, when an Armistice was agreed to.</p>
                  
                  <p>Next week we begin a new journey, one that starts to assess how and why certain memories of the war were formed. Our historians put forth the argument that memory is shaped very differently and there are no two same experiences of the war.</p>

                  <p><strong>Dan Todman</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>Todman&#8217;s article examines how the Third Battle or Ypres or Battle of Passchendaele (12 October &#8211; 10 November 1917) had been subsequently represented in books, television documentaries and in popular memory. He argues that Passchendaele is remembered an iconic Great War battle, but as a historical event it has been thoroughly misunderstood.</p>
                  
                  <p>In the 1920s and 1930s, Ypres became a place of pilgrimage and a site of war memorials such as the Menin Gate. Todman points out that Ypres became a popular destination for British tours to the Western Front. Perhaps more significantly, methods of commemoration were developed for those who could not visit Ypres and the surrounding countryside. These included newspaper articles and Australian artist Will Longstaff&#8217;s painting <em>The Menin Gate at Midnight</em> &#8211; the print of which became a common feature in Australian homes in the interwar period.</p>
                  
                  <p>Todman points out that attempts to write Third Ypres into history varied widely in approach, as did the intended audience and the quality of analysis. He argues that the books of the military commentator and journalist, Basil Liddell Hart, and wartime politicians such as Winston Churchill&#8217;s <em>The World Crisis</em> and David Lloyd George&#8217;s <em>War Memoirs</em>, were influential because they were best sellers and reached large audiences. Conversely, the British Official History volumes published the 1940s had no effect on the memory of Passchendaele.</p>
                  
                  <p>In the 1960s Leon Wolff&#8217;s <em>In Flanders Fields</em>, A. J. P. Taylor&#8217;s <em>Illustrated History of the First World War</em> and <em>The Great War</em> television series had all misrepresented the battle, perpetuating the memory of Third Ypres as futile. Todman concludes that, although military  historians have produced detailed scholarly histories based on archival research that demonstrate that the battle showed the growing competence of the British Army, the prevailing popular memory will continue.</p>

                  <p>As you will recall from the first week, this course seeks to understand why we remember the First World War in a particular way.</p>
                  
                  <p>In this week&#8217;s discussion we consider the non-combatant, whether they served with the armed forces or assisted in the war effort, non-combatants are missing from the historiography of the First World War.</p>
                  
                  <p>Historians have provided a multi-layered narrative of the experience of the Great War, ranging from active participation in military operations and conflict, to the impact of war on society. Examinations of support roles in war such as supply, transport, communication and medical services, for example, are missing.</p>

                  <p>The memory of historical events inevitably changes over time. During and immediately after the First World War, there was no collective memory of the war. The people who had lived through the events of 1914 to 1918 may have shared similar experiences, such as soldiering in the trenches, or working in munitions factories, but each person had their own individual memory of the war.</p>
                  
                  <p>As years passed, the First World War gradually drifted more distantly into the past. The individual memories of the war were replaced by a collective memory shared by a community or nation of people, most of whom had not directly experienced the war.</p>
                  
                  <p>The memory of the First World War also changed over time for two reasons.</p>
                  
                  <p>The first was that views of the war have naturally changed in response to subsequent historical events from the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Second World War, the Cold War to the ongoing wars in the Middle East.</p>
                  
                  <p>The second is that as the First World War passed out of personal memory, poetry and novels played an important role in creating a public memory of the war.</p>
                  
                  <p>Memories of a major historical event inevitably will change over the time. The mystery for us is to try to understand why did the memory of the First World War in the English-speaking world change in the way it did?</p>
                  
                  <p>Why is it the British popular memory of the Western Front stops with the Somme in 1916, and ignores the British victories of 1918? The equivalent for the Second World War would be a British memory of that conflict that stops in 1942 with the disastrous raid on Dieppe and Rommel advancing on Egypt, and ignores the British victories in Normandy and Burma in 1944 and the final victory over Germany and Japan.</p>
                  
                  <p>Why is it that the French public memory of the Western Front is so different from the British public memory?</p>
                  
                  <p>Why is it that Turks, Australians and New Zealanders remember the Gallipoli campaign as nation-building events rather than pointless and futile battles?</p>
                  
                  <p>These are questions for which there are no definite answers. However, if we ask the questions, and have the discussion, we can learn new things about the past and those who went before us, and also learn new things about the present and ourselves.</p>
                  
                  <p>In our final week our historians will guide us to very interesting insights into the memory of the war and how this has been shaped through differing mediums over the last century.  Christina Spittel speaks about how certain novels created a particular memory of the war and Keith Jeffery discusses the contrasting ways Irish people have remembered the First World War.</p>
                  
                  <p>We also consider the memory of the Gallipoli Campaign in some of the nations which served there. We ask  &#8220;Why is there such a connection to this failed battle to Australia and New Zealand?&#8221;</p>
