                  <p>Let&#8217;s get started! In this course we&#8217;ll be asking you to take an active role in your own learning &#8212; to investigate some issues that concern you, to go out into the world and make observations about these issues, to discuss your observations with others in the course, and to start testing out some creative interventions. So we start the course with a very practical activity.</p>
                  
                  <h2 id=""a-planet-in-crisis"">A planet in crisis?</h2>
                  <p>Yes, there are a lot of bad things happening out there; we read about them every day. As you&#8217;ll come to see in this course, environmental issues sit at the nexus of science, culture, society and human value systems. Issues like climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution have a wide range of causes and effects and generate diverse opinions and attitudes. So how do we start to identify and untangle these different influences?</p>
                  
                  <p>This activity involves evaluating information about environmental issues as reported in the popular news media.  The news articles will help you build familiarity with these issues and also enable us to have discussions about the entanglements between science and humanities, facts and values, in each of these cases.</p>
                  
                  <p>In what is now being called a <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/post-truth-a-guide-for-the-perplexed/"">&#8220;post-truth&#8221; era</a> the task of critically analysing news media is particularly important. The main thing we hope you take away from this activity is a newfound sensitivity to all the complex interacting factors at play in different environmental situations.</p>

                  <p>Read the five-page article, &#8220;<a href=""http://environmentalhumanities.org/arch/vol1/EH1.1.pdf"">Thinking through the Environment,  Unsettling the Humanities</a>,&#8221; to gain greater understanding of drivers of the emerging field of Environmental Humanities.</p>
                  
                  <p>The article was written in 2012 for the inaugural issue of the <em>Environmental Humanities Journal</em> by a team of leading Environmental Humanities scholars, including three educators from this MOOC&#8212;Thom Van Dooren, Deborah Bird Rose and Matt Kearnes. It begins with a brief overview of how and why the field of Environmental Humanities emerged and then discusses some of the key aims of the field.</p>
                  
                  <p>Although the authors state that interest in environmental issues has grown within different disciplines&#8212;resulting in sub-disciplines such as environmental history, political ecology and eco-criticism&#8212;they point out that environmental humanities &#8220;is a result of something more than the growth of work within a range of distinct disciplinary areas&#8221;.  <sup><a href=""#references"">[1]</a></sup> They state:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><em>In many ways it is not yet clear what the environmental humanities are or will become. On one level, the environmental humanities might be understood as a useful <strong>umbrella</strong>, bringing together many sub-fields that have emerged over the past few decades and facilitating new conversations between them. On another, perhaps more ambitious level, the environmental humanities also challenges these disciplinary fields of inquiry, functioning as a <strong>provocation</strong> to a more interdisciplinary set of interventions directed toward some of the most pressing issues of our time. Both approaches are currently cohabiting under the one banner.</em><sup><a href=""#references"">[2]</a></sup></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>The field of Environmental Humanities (EH) has rapidly evolved since the article was written in 2012, but the description of the two levels that environmental humanities operates on&#8212;as umbrella and as a provocation&#8212;still holds.</p>
                  
                  <p>In the next few steps, you will see examples of some of the key environmentally focused sub-disciplines and sub-fields that Environmental Humanities brings together, such as Environmental History, Eco-Criticism and Environmental Philosophy. Please note, it is not an exhaustive list (for example, art is not included here as we explore art in later weeks, e.g. in <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/remaking-nature/2/steps/119915"">Step 4.4</a>). In Week 3 we will focus on the more ambitious interdisciplinary aim of Environmental Humanities and consider how EH challenges disciplinary fields of inquiry.</p>

                  <p>The first sub-discipline that we will introduce is Environmental History.</p>
                  
                  <p>Why is history important in understanding contemporary environmental issues? A leading Australian scholar of environmental and natural resource policy, Stephen Dovers, offers us one important answer:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><em>&#8230;knowing more about how we got where we are might tell us more about ourselves. Pragmatically, this may be one more perspective we can bring to bear in our quest to solve the environmental problems of the present. An environmental issue without a past is altogether as mysterious as a person without a past.</em> <sup><a href=""#references"">[1]</a></sup></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>The discipline of Environmental History developed in the 1960s and 1970s as a sub-discipline of History. However, early forms of Environmental History also existed in other disciplines, such as Geography. One of the prominent features of environmental history is the way in which the environment is depicted as active, rather than passive. Tom Griffiths, a prominent Australian Environmental Historian, writes that, in history writing, nature has often been a &#8220;stage and setting for the human drama.&#8221;<sup><a href=""#references"">[2]</a></sup> In contrast, environmental historians seek to enrol an active nature in their historical accounts. In particular, environmental historians often travel between timescales, integrating human stories with geological and evolutionary time frames and planetary processes. However, as Griffiths writes, &#8220;environmental history remains, at heart, one of the humanities, concerned with cultural, moral, economic and political questions, and founded in narrative.&#8221;<sup><a href=""#references"">[3]</a></sup></p>
                  
                  <p>As implied in the quote by Griffiths, many environmental historians also emphasise a commitment to narrative. One of the best known American environmental historians, William Cronon, states that &#8220;the special task of environmental history is to assert that stories about the past are better, all other things being equal, if they increase our attention to nature and the place of people within it.&#8221;<sup><a href=""#references"">[4]</a></sup></p>

                  <p>Environmental Philosophy gained prominence as a sub-discipline of philosophy in the 1970s, primarily in response to emerging environmental challenges.</p>
                  
                  <p>A range of different approaches to considering human environmental relations emerged in the sub-discipline, such as Ecofeminism (Val Plumwood), Animal Liberation (Peter Singer), the Land Ethic (Aldo Leopold) and Deep Ecology (Arne Naess). Within these approaches there was a marked shift away from anthropocentric &#8212; or human-centred &#8212; environmental ethics. In particular, these approaches advocated greater consideration of the moral status and intrinsic value of non-humans, rather than determining the value of non-human entities based on human needs and desires.</p>
                  
                  <p>The influential Australian Feminist Philosopher, Val Plumwood, writing on the legacy of environmental philosophy, states:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><em>First appearing in academia in the area of value theory in the early 1970s, environmental philosophy has now made itself felt across the whole discipline of philosophy, taking in core areas such as political philosophy, justice ethics, history of philosophy, moral epistemology and metaphysics. In all these areas philosophers have exposed the dangerous logic of current frameworks that devalue and background the non-human world. Some have argued that our human-centredness weaves a dangerous set of illusions about the human condition right into the logic of our basic conceptual structures.</em><sup><a href=""#references"">[1]</a></sup></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>A key component of Plumwood&#8217;s environmental philosophy that has been widely adopted by environmental humanities scholars is her call to articulate human &#8220;embeddedness in and dependency on nature&#8221; through two &#8220;tasks&#8221;, which she sums up as &#8220;the tasks of (re) situating humans in ecological terms and non-humans in ethical terms&#8221;. <sup><a href=""#references"">[1]</a></sup></p>
                  
                  <p>For Plumwood these two tasks have both ethical and justice dimensions:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><em>The inability or refusal to recognise the way non-humans contribute to or support our lives encourages us to starve them of resources. It has justice aspects because we refuse to give other species their share of the earth, and it has ethical aspects because we fail them in care, consideration and attention.</em> <sup><a href=""#references"">[1]</a></sup></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>Questions of ethics and justice are central to Environmental Humanities, prompting us to consider our human responsibilities when we understand ourselves as embedded with and dependent upon non-human others.</p>

                  <p>Work in Environmental Humanities, particularly by Australian scholars, emerges out of an awareness of the interconnected histories of colonial settlement, violence and displacement.</p>
                  
                  <p>Two Australian scholars Deborah Bird Rose and Libby Robbin write:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><em>Those of us settler society scholars have&#8230; [an] ethical imperative here: to be responsive to Indigenous people&#8217;s knowledges and aspirations for justice. The ecological humanities thus engage with connectivity and commitment in a time of crisis and concern.</em><sup><a href=""#references"">[1]</a></sup></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>Postcolonial approaches include reflections on ways in which academic research is conducted and critiques of what counts as factual evidence within Western scientific knowledge traditions. The prominent Indigenous scholar from New Zealand, Linda Tuhiwai Smith, articulates how research methods must be decolonised to support social justice and challenge harmful government policies and imperialism. In her oft cited book <a href=""https://www.zedbooks.net/shop/book/decolonizing-methodologies/""><em>Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples</em></a> (1999), she describes a Maori Indigenous research agenda, arguing that:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><em>We have a different epistemological tradition which frames the way we see the world, the way we organize ourselves in it, the questions we ask and the solutions we seek.</em> <sup><a href=""#references"">[2]</a></sup></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>Deborah Bird Rose will take up some of these concerns in her discussion of the nature-culture dualism in relation to the colonisation of Australia, in Week 2, <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/remaking-nature/2/steps/119870"">Step 2.5</a>.</p>

                  <p>One of the goals of the Environmental Humanities is to understand the way knowledge about the environment is constructed, and create new understandings that demonstrate greater care and concern. In the next steps, we look more closely at the historical development of the concept of &#8220;nature.&#8221;</p>
                  
                  <p>Nature is a complex term. Raymond Williams famously said that it may be the most complex term in the English language.<sup><a href=""#references"">[1]</a></sup> But there are two main ways in which the term is typically used:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <ul>
                      <li>nature as <em>essence</em></li>
                      <li>nature as <em>nonhuman</em></li>
                    </ul>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <h2 id=""nature-as-essence"">Nature as essence</h2>
                  <p>When used in this way, the term &#8220;nature&#8221;&#8217; refers to the fundamental or inner character, or proper functioning, of something. It is in this sense that people might say things like &#8220;the nature of a triangle is such that in all possible worlds it will have three sides,&#8221;<sup><a href=""#references"">[2]</a></sup> or debate the &#8220;nature&#8221; of modern architecture. We might also speak about &#8220;human nature&#8221; in this sense &#8212; saying that it is in our nature to be greedy and self-serving; or caring and considerate.</p>
                  
                  <p>The point here is that anything and everything might be said to have a &#8220;nature&#8221; in the sense of essence: buildings, triangles, atoms, even people. How to define and describe these various natures &#8212; that is, the essential or &#8220;proper&#8221; features of a thing &#8212; will continue to be controversial though.</p>
                  
                  <h2 id=""nature-as-nonhuman"">Nature as nonhuman</h2>
                  <p>The other main way that we tend to use the term nature is to describe the collection of nonhuman entities in the world. In this sense, wilderness is often understood to be the purest form of nature. This is probably the dominant way that the term is used today. In this view, &#8220;nature&#8221; is perceived to be a place <em>out there</em>, beyond the borders of the city, untouched by human hands. From this perspective there may still be little pockets of &#8220;nature&#8221; in the city &#8212; parks or backyards &#8212; but the extent to which we will be prepared to call them nature will depend on how much they have been altered by human presence or impact. As you will see in the coming materials, this view of nature is problematic.</p>
                  
                  <h2 id=""confused-natures"">Confused natures</h2>
                  <p>It is the second meaning of nature &#8212; nature as non-human &#8212; that we will focus on in this course, but the two cannot be neatly separated from each other. For example, if someone says that genetically modified foods are &#8220;unnatural&#8221;, what do they mean? They might mean that genetic technologies have altered the plant&#8217;s essence (understood as its genome), that they have altered its proper character or state. But they might also mean that these technologies are an imposition of human influence, a perversion of a previously, &#8220;natural&#8221; form (a form unaltered by human action).</p>
                  
                  <p>This example also highlights the important political and ethical work that this term often does. As Raymond Williams noted:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><em>In some serious argument, but even more in popular controversy and in various kinds of contemporary rhetoric, we continually come across propositions of the form &#8220;Nature is &#8230; &#8220;, or &#8220;Nature shows &#8230; &#8220;, or &#8220;Nature teaches &#8230; &#8220;. And what is usually apparent about what is then said is that it is selective, according to the speaker&#8217;s general purpose.</em><sup><a href=""#references"">[3]</a></sup></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>To call something &#8220;unnatural&#8221; implies that it is not proper, not how it ought to be. To be called &#8220;natural&#8221; often implies the opposite.</p>

"2.4","Dualisms","Article","","","Week 2","2017-01-23","23 Jan","Week 2: The invention of nature","https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/remaking-nature/2/steps/153860","[<div class=""a-text-context a-text-context--bold-intro"">
                  <p>The key to understanding how &#8220;nature&#8221; (as nonhuman) functions in the modern world is appreciating that it is a strongly dualistic term.</p>
                  
                  <p>At the simplest level, a <em>dualism</em> is the conceptual division of something into two distinct parts. In Western thought, nature has tended to be understood as dualistically opposed to culture or humanity. Nature is those parts or places that are (relatively) unaffected by people.</p>
                  
                  <p>This way of dividing up the world positions humans as fundamentally outside nature. As William Cronon notes, from this perspective: &#8220;The place where we are is the place where nature is not.&#8221; <sup><a href=""#references"">[1]</a></sup></p>
                  
                  <p>For those of us raised and educated within this kind of framework it seems entirely obvious, natural even. How else could we understand things?</p>
                  
                  <p>It turns out, however, that many other cultures do not, and have not, divided the world up in this way. The nature/culture dualism is the product of the very particular cultural history of the West.<sup><a href=""#references"">[2]</a><a href=""#references"">[3]</a><a href=""#references"">[4]</a></sup> It is not &#8220;true&#8221; in any meaningful sense, it is just one way of understanding things &#8212; and potentially a very problematic one. The ecofeminist philosopher Val Plumwood has called the nature/culture dualism &#8220;the foundational delusion of the West&#8221; and has argued that it is a &#8220;dangerous doctrine, strongly implicated in the environmental crisis.&#8221;<sup><a href=""#references"">[5]</a></sup></p>
                  
                  <p>Plumwood also pointed out that it is not just nature and culture that are understood dualistically in western culture. Instead, she argued that a set of &#8220;interrelated and mutually reinforcing dualisms &#8230; forms a fault-line which runs through its [western culture&#8217;s] entire conceptual system.&#8221; <sup><a href=""#references"">[6]</a></sup></p>
                  
                  <p>Some of the key dualisms she identified are:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <ul>
                      <li>culture / nature</li>
                      <li>reason / nature</li>
                      <li>male / female</li>
                      <li>mind / body</li>
                      <li>master / slave</li>
                      <li>reason / matter</li>
                      <li>human / nature</li>
                      <li>civilised / primitive</li>
                      <li>human / animal</li>
                    </ul>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>These dualistic categories are not just listed here in any old way. All of those listed on the left have historically been understood to exist in a dominant or superior position to those on the right. Furthermore, dualisms &#8220;naturalise&#8221; this hierarchy &#8212; that is, they make it appear to be &#8220;just the way things are&#8221; (part of their essence or structure). The slave doesn&#8217;t just happen to be a slave, say because she was born into a particular family; she is a slave because she lacks the rationality and civilised bearing of the master &#8212; in some fundamental sense she ought to be a slave.</p>
                  
                  <p>Understanding dualisms in this more detailed way we are better able to appreciate the complex implications of nature as a conceptual category and its dualistic relationship to the category culture. It should also be clear why scholars interested in issues of domination related to gender, sexuality and race have also taken a strong interest in the nature/culture dualism; this way of characterising the world has implications well beyond what we ordinarily think of as &#8220;environmental&#8221; issues.</p>
                  
                  <h2 id=""how-did-we-get-here"">How did we get here?</h2>
                  <p>If the nature/culture dualism is a product of a peculiarly Western or European cultural history, then how did we happen to get here? How did the West end up with this particular way of dividing up the world?</p>
                  
                  <p>The history of ideas is a complex field. Even once we appreciate that our understanding of &#8220;nature&#8221; is just that, a particular understanding, not reality itself, teasing out how we arrived here is difficult. In all likelihood there is no single, simple, root cause.</p>
                  
                  <p>Plumwood calls the nature-culture dualism</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><em>the love-child of the old dominant narrative of human mastery and centrality mated with the much younger circumstance of human experience of commodification in the global city.</em><sup><a href=""#references"">[7]</a></sup></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>Plumwood&#8217;s reference to the city points to forms of human life that are increasingly alienated from (many) nonhumans. While we might still interact with urban wildlife and small &#8220;green spaces,&#8221; fewer and fewer of us spend serious time, or earn a living, interacting with those parts of the world we call &#8220;nature.&#8221; From inside the city &#8212; in contrast to life as a gatherer/hunter, on a farm or in a small town &#8212; it becomes much easier to see nature as something that exists &#8220;out there,&#8221; separate from human life. When children don&#8217;t know that milk comes from cows and think that bears make honey, this alienation seems particularly acute.</p>
                  
                  <p>But the first part of Plumwood&#8217;s quote points to a deeper history of dualistic thinking: &#8220;the old dominant narrative of human mastery and centrality.&#8221; What is this?</p>
                  
                  <p>There are probably many aspects to this narrative in the West, many strands that have come together. The philosopher J. Baird Callicott sums up the key ones in the following quote:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><em>In the first book of the Bible, alone among all the other creatures, God makes man in His own image, giving him dominion over and charging him to subdue the earth and all its denizens. In ancient Greek philosophy, man is set apart from nature because he alone among the animals is supposed to be rational. In the late medieval and early modern periods, thinkers as different from one another as Thomas Aquinas and Rene Descartes synthesized these two strands of thought, the Judeo-Christian and Greco-Roman. Thus the man/nature dualism in each augmented the other. And Descartes&#8217; contemporary, Francis Bacon, set the modern agenda for the scientific conquest of nature by man. If we can discover the working principles &#8212; the divinely ordained laws &#8212; of nature, he presciently pointed out, we can bend it to our will.</em><sup><a href=""#references"">[8]</a></sup></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>And so this, in a nutshell, is what we tend to mean by the term &#8220;nature,&#8221; and how it is that we have arrived at this understanding. But is this an accurate or helpful way to understand and divide up the world?</p>

"2.6","Example 2: Environmental determinism","Article","","","Week 2","2017-01-23","23 Jan","Week 2: The invention of nature","https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/remaking-nature/2/steps/119872","[<div class=""a-text-context a-text-context--bold-intro"">
                  <p>Environmental determinism, or the idea that the environment (including geography and climate) determines the character and attributes of cultural and ethnic groups, was historically used to justify Western colonisation.</p>
                  
                  <p>In the article below, Matthew Kearnes critiques the theory of &#8220;environmental determinism&#8221; through a discussion of two well-known, twentieth-century texts. Specifically, he explores how racism is entangled with these determinist narratives.</p>
                  
                  <h2 id=""determinist-trajectories"">Determinist trajectories</h2>
                  
                  <p>A particularly strong lineage that runs through the development of modernist environmental thinking is the theory of environmental determinism &#8212; the broad claim that environmental conditions determine the character and attributes of (geographically distinct) cultural and ethnic groups. While this deeply problematic theory has enjoyed a level of currency throughout Western philosophical and cultural history, it was particularly evident in the early part of the twentieth century, shaping the development of the modern disciplines of area studies, anthropology, geography and environmental studies.</p>
                  
                  <p><em>Civilisation and Climate</em>, a well-known text of this era by Ellsworth Huntington, is a particularly striking example of this genre of environmental thinking. First published in 1915 (and re-printed at least ten times), Huntington&#8217;s text opens with perhaps the clearest expression of environmental and climatic determinism, arguing that &#8220;the races of the earth are like trees. Each according to its kind brings forth the fruit known as civilisation&#8221; <sup><a href=""#references"">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
                  
                  <p>Have a quick browse through the early pages of <a href=""https://archive.org/details/civilizationandc031898mbp"">Huntington&#8217;s work</a>. What do you note about the chapter headings and themes of the book?</p>
                  
                  <p>Huntington&#8217;s race theory is clear from the start. If different races can be distinguished by the sophistication of their culture and civilisation, it is a short step for Huntington to pose his central theory &#8212; that climatic conditions influence the cultural sophistication of different racial and ethnic groups. Perhaps predictably, racial groups residing in temperate climates appear rather positively in Huntington&#8217;s account, while in comparison the &#8220;denizens of the torrid zone are slow and backward, and we almost universally agree that this is connected with the damp, steady heat&#8221; <sup><a href=""#references"">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
                  
                  <p>Huntington&#8217;s climatic determinism is of course a thin veil for a virulent form of Euro-centric racism. It is important to note that Huntington&#8217;s theories of racial superiority are an expression of the emergence of fascist political movements in Europe and America (Huntington was a noted supporter of eugenics and wrote sympathetically about Hitler and the onset of German National Socialism) <sup><a href=""#references"">[3]</a></sup>. They point to a broader geopolitical discourse of Western colonialism that, in the words of Denis Cosgrove, &#8220;sought to base political and military strategy on what were regarded as enduring patterns of lands, seas, climates, and resources across the terrestrial sphere&#8221;. <sup><a href=""#references"">[4]</a></sup></p>
                  
                  <p>Huntington&#8217;s particular mode of reasoning, which seeks to establish the causal relations between environment and civilisation, is by no means unique to the disciplines of geography and environmental science. For example, Peder Anker, in his study of the development of the discipline of ecology &#8212; <em>Imperial Ecology: Environmental Order in the British Empire, 1895&#8211;1945</em> &#8212; demonstrates that the consolidation of the ecology discipline coincided with the final years of the British empire. Anker focuses on two central figures &#8212; the British ecologist George Tansley and the South African Botanist, politician and advocate of racial segregation Jan Christian Smuts &#8212; each of whom deployed ecological thinking to &#8220;solve the empire&#8217;s environmental, social and racial problems&#8221; <sup><a href=""#references"">[5]</a></sup>. Smuts in particular developed an eco-philosophy he termed &#8220;holism&#8221; that influenced the development of botanical science in South Africa and the discipline of ecology more generally. For Smuts:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><em>Every organism from the lowest microorganism to the highest mind represented a whole, and all these entities were connected into greater wholes, which in turn constituted the greatest whole.</em> <sup><a href=""#references"">[6]</a></sup></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>To this vaguely mystical conception of the unity of the natural world Smuts gave a distinctly political twist, arguing, in Anker&#8217;s words, that:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><em>Human freedom is dependent on humans&#8217; place in &#8216;the causal chain of Nature,&#8217; which grants them &#8216;degrees of freedom&#8217; according to the perfection of their respective whole. The organic process of selection caused this degree of freedom. To Smuts the mind is an organ of wholes with the ability to organize a social self and social environment, and an ability that results in &#8216;different levels of culture&#8217; depending on the &#8216;level of mental culture&#8217; and the holistic urge.</em><sup><a href=""#references"">[7]</a></sup></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>In the same way that Huntington&#8217;s explicitly racist theory of environment sought to establish causal relations between climate and cultural sophistication and expression, in Smut&#8217;s ecological vision everything (both human and nonhuman) has a unique place in a greater whole. The danger for Smuts was when this order was disrupted, which prompted the projects of environmental conservation and racial segregation. In the words of Anker again,</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><em>[Smuts&#8217;] ecophilosophy served him as a glorification of white supremacy, with a division of society into high and low personalities, while still defending unification of South Africa, the British Empire, and ultimately the world through the League of Nations</em>. <sup><a href=""#references"">[8]</a></sup></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>One way of reading these connections is simply that they are an expression of the co-joined histories of colonialism and the modern environmental sciences. Might we conclude that the theories of environmental and climatic determinism simply sat alongside the colonial experience but did not add materially to it? Or might we find some comfort in the suggestion that the explicitly racist connotations of both theories were simply a by-product of the personal predilections of their chief proponents? Surely this mode of thinking isn&#8217;t evident in contemporary environmental politics and practice?</p>
                  
                  <p>Of course, in reality the argument that the colonial race theory, ecological holism and environmental determinism were simply accidental bedfellows is a profound mis-reading of entangled histories of these projects.</p>
                  
                  <p>A number of contemporary scholars have begun to identify what we might think of as a &#8220;climatic determinism&#8221; in the public discussion of global warming and climate change. This determinism is characterised by images of climate-induced warfare, conflict and migration.</p>

                  <p>This week we summarised the development of the concept of nature in the Western world.</p>
                  
                  <p>We introduced, and critiqued, a set of mutually reinforcing dualisms that run through the fabric of contemporary Western thought. We saw that these dualisms have far-reaching effects on the health of the planet and on issues of social and environmental justice.</p>
                  
                  <p>We critiqued nature/culture and other Western dualisms, focusing on some of their problematic implications:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>separation of humans from nature,</li>
                    <li>human mastery over &#8220;nature&#8221;,</li>
                    <li>nature as wilderness,</li>
                    <li>environmental determinism.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>So, should Nature, as a European invention, be abandoned?</p>
                  
                  <p>Of course, this doesn&#8217;t mean chopping down the forests and filling in the mangroves! The end of &#8220;nature&#8221; as a conceptual category might just be the beginning of a more sustainable and ethical engagement with our nonhuman, or more-than-human, world.</p>

                  <p>As a first approximation, we suggested that the Environmental Humanities can do what the sciences can&#8217;t do, what they leave to one side.</p>
                  
                  <p>If we assume that the work of the sciences is to generate reliable data (and that&#8217;s a bit of an assumption), then the work of the Environmental Humanities is to investigate the relation of facts to values. We take the view that no fact is born without a set of values attached, and that the separation of facts from values is an artificial separation.</p>
                  
                  <p>As we saw in Week 2, there was something quite artificial in the way that modern Europeans separated nature off from human society and made it the domain of science. In this domain, objects could be stabilised, as science ruled over the laws of nature.</p>
                  
                  <p>Nature was <em>over there</em> to be exploited. Technology multiplied the effects of energy, in the form of extracted carbon, to build new ways of living on Earth, mainly in vast cities. We thought our distance from nature meant it would not react to our industrial activities &#8212; that exploitation would come for free, so to speak. But now we see nature reacting in all sorts of relatively unpredictable ways.</p>
                  
                  <p>The passage from knowing the facts about nature to efficient extraction of energy comes with greater costs than we thought. One cost is the imperative to change the concepts and the stories we tell as we rebuild our relationship with our planetary home.</p>
                  
                  <p>In the mid-twentieth century, scientists&#8217; excitement over their capacity to split the atom came with an attitude of disinterestedness, even as nuclear bombs destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki: <em>we just deal with the technical side of things &#8212; others can deal with the moral consequences</em>. Since then the story has changed; more people, perhaps most, accept that facts and values are always entangled. If we accept that entanglement, then the new story we tell about nature is not about its pure scientific facts, as if they are &#8220;just there&#8221;, but that facts come into being for reasons like curiosity, need, concern and necessity: human emotions and needs! It is the normal state of affairs for facts and values to be entangled, and we can&#8217;t necessarily prioritise the one over the other.</p>
                  
                  <p>&#8220;Matters of fact&#8221; are also &#8220;matters of concern&#8221; <sup><a href=""#references"">[1]</a></sup>. What one can do is rank matters of concern in order of importance.  Some sort of collective, like a parliament, has the job of doing just that: is it more important to build speed bumps throughout the city (because we are concerned about road safety), or to make the penalties for drink driving harsher? Will a concern for an endangered species override the desire to lease the native forests for logging? The ranking of such problems, which might involve incorporating the &#8220;point of view&#8221; of endangered species in the discussion, is not just a problem for sciences and facts: humanities expertise needs to be on the team as well.</p>

Now, let&#8217;s review the class poll results in more detail.</p>
                  
                  <h2 id=""poll-results"">Poll results</h2>

                  <p>The poll responses are scored in terms of ecocentric, custodian and anthropocentric responses to help gauge the current perspectives of people in the course:</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Ecocentric</strong> &#8211; nature-centred. People with an ecocentric viewpoint tend to see nature as having its own intrinsic value, with a right to exist for its own sake.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Custodian</strong> &#8211; being responsible for the maintenance of something. People with a custodian or stewardship approach to environment tend to feel that humans have a moral obligation to protect nature, both in the present and future.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Anthropocentric</strong> &#8211; human-centred. People with an anthropocentric viewpoint tend to see nature based on its value as a resource to be exploited by humans for human benefit.</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <ul>
                      <li>You might want to refer back to the <a href=""https://unswmooc.typeform.com/report/IksDj4/NoKg"">original class results</a>.</li>

                    </ul>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>The purpose of the poll is to make a conceptual point, rather than an empirical one (as arguably surveys are too crude a research instrument to offer a nuanced evaluation of values).</p>
                  
                  <p>What we hope to show is that even among the different people in this course &#8212; who all presumably share some kind of interest in the Environmental Humanities &#8212; there is great diversity in how we view and value &#8220;nature&#8221; and the environment across different themes and issues.</p>
                  
                  <h2 id=""educator-feedback"">Educator feedback</h2>
                  <p><sub><em>posted on 01 February 2017</em></sub></p>
                  
                  <p>As an initial caveat, it is important to note that there are methodological limitations, so we should avoid reading too deeply into the data. Ideally, if I wanted to gauge people&#8217;s environmental values in more depth, I would prefer to conduct interviews with people, as values are qualitative and do not always fit neatly into the three categories. Nevertheless, the quiz does provide us with an interesting broad brush picture of people&#8217;s environmental perspectives who are taking the course. Its main purpose was to spark a broader discussion about our environmental values. And, seeing the many comments about the poll, hopefully it has achieved this modest objective.</p>
                  
                  <p>A starting question to think about is do environmental values and attitudes matter? If we have good science and technology do we need to consider or care about how people think about, perceive and understand their environments?</p>
                  
                  <p>I would say an emphatic yes. Environmental policy and human action and even science are not apolitical or asocial activities, they are shaped by people and their contexts. We all might agree that the conservation of something is needed, but we might differ in terms of our rational. Should we conserve forests because they provide timber; should we conserve forests because they are beautiful places to visit and they absorb CO<sub>2</sub>; or we should conserve forests because they are a home for other species? Perspectives will influence the way we interact with the forest. Appreciating these nuances and differences is a good way to unpack some of the complexities that underpin conservation and environmental policy.</p>
                  
                  <p>In terms of you all, a quick look at the results shows that people in their course have tended to be much more ecocentric in their perspective of the environment: 68% of answers were ecocentric; 27% were custodian; while only 5% were anthropocentric (this compares to the answers last year, which were: 47% ecocentric; 45% custodian; and only 6% anthropocentric. We have become more ecocentric!)</p>
                  
                  <p>As many pointed out, this is perhaps unsurprising, given that a &#8216;Remaking Nature&#8217; course will probably attract more ecocentric individuals.  It would be interesting to see, for example, the results if their politicians took the same quiz. Nevertheless, even still there is still great diversity in terms of your answers, and there was a trend of people tending to cluster around either custodian or ecocentric perspectives. Some see humans as having a moral obligation to protect nature; others want to see humans more as a part of nature. People based in Europe seemed to be more &#8216;ecocentric,&#8217; and those in Africa more &#8216;custodian.&#8217; Why do people think there might be a difference here?</p>
                  
                  <p>There were some interesting variations across themes. When asked questions about forests and wildlife, people tended to have more ecocentric answers; while custodian and anthropocentric perspectives tended to be more prominent with the cities question. Unsurprisingly, I guess, it seems that people see cities in more anthropocentric terms. Maybe we could try and challenge this in the course.</p>
                  
                  <p>I will leave my very basic analysis there, and encourage you to go through the data and share your own analyses and ideas. I will be active on the comments section, and perhaps as a &#8216;crowd&#8217; we can draw some interesting ideas from looking at the results. So please post and share your thoughts!</p>

                    <p><em>There is a new science studies afoot, of which this special issue is a part, and its key characteristic is multispecies love.

                  <p>This week we explored how the Environmental Humanities can go beyond scientific understandings by generating knowledge about the relationships between facts and values.</p>
                  
                  <p>We presented a broad range of examples to get you thinking about the types of knowledge Environmental Humanities can generate. We explained how Environmental Humanities aims to consider the values and viewpoints of different human and non-human stakeholders. We then asked how we collectively might move beyond anthropocentric notions, through discussions of the liveliness or agency of things.</p>
                  
                  <p>One of the common themes over the past few weeks has been a call to remake our understandings of nature and environment. Next week, we will start to explore how we can begin to tell new stories about the world and our place within it.</p>

                  <p>In the past weeks, we have used approaches from the humanities to probe how knowledge about the environment is constructed, and to challenge some dominant Western understandings &#8212; such as anthropocentrism and the division between nature and culture.</p>
                  
                  <p>This week we will explore these concepts through the lens of <em>narratives</em> &#8212; or the stories we tell ourselves about the world. We will see some examples of narratives, and we will argue that remaking our understandings of nature requires creating new narratives about the world and our place with it.</p>
                  
                  <p>As you will see, narratives are propagated through the stories we tell ourselves about the world, and these stories can take many forms &#8212; from written works of fiction to news broadcasts, and from artistic representations to manifestos. We will discuss how narratives have the power to shape not only our understanding of the world, but the material world itself.</p>
                  
                  <p>Finally, you will play a creative storytelling game &#8212; the Game of Global Futures &#8212; which will give you practice creating and disseminating stories and get you thinking about the types of narratives you might want to promote.</p>

                  <p>In this step, Matthew Kearnes critiques representations of climate-induced migration in mass media. After you have read Matthew&#8217;s critique, we will ask you to consider how a different story about climate change migration might be told.</p>
                  
                  <p>Let&#8217;s have a look at some of the images through which climate-induced migration is depicted.</p>
                  
                  <p>Images of floods abound in the literature on climate change, and one of the most common assumptions made is that rising seas levels, and flooded landscapes, will lead to &#8220;floods of people&#8221; forced to migrate, precipitating resource conflict and security threats.</p>
                  
                  <p>One particularly interesting example of the ways in which climate-induced flooding is figured as a cause of social threat was the London Futures Climate Change Exhibition, which featured fictional depictions of London by illustrators Robert Graves and Didier Madoc-Jones. The exhibition, hosted by the Museum of London in 2011, was <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2010/oct/27/london-futures-exhibition"">featured in the Guardian newspaper</a>.</p>

                  <p>With images of flooded iconic London landmarks like the Thames Barrier, Parliament Square and Piccadilly Circus, the exhibition was clearly designed to be provocative and challenging.</p>
                  
                  <p>However, with images of Parliament Square transformed into a rice paddy, and a climate shanty town around Buckingham palace, the exhibition is also indicative of the ways in which images of environmental change are interpreted socially and politically. In <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2010/oct/27/london-futures-climate-change-exhibition"">response</a> to the exhibition George Marshall, founder of the <a href=""http://www.climateoutreach.org.uk/"">Climate Outreach Information Network</a>, argued that:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><em>The greatest concern with this show is not that it parts with reality, but that it speaks all too well to real prejudices against immigrants &#8220;swamping&#8221; British culture.</em></p>
                  
                    <p><em>This is a recurring theme.</em></p>
                  
                    <p><em>One postcard shows Asian peasants working in paddy fields in the shadow of Big Ben. Two postcards in the series show shantytowns around Nelson&#8217;s Column and Buckingham Palace.</em></p>
                  
                    <p><em>These images cause deep disquiet for those who work with refugees and immigrants. &#8230; These concerns are exacerbated by the language used in the captions. The caption for the Buckingham Palace shantytown talks of the royal family being surrounded by &#8220;overwhelming numbers of immigrants&#8221;. Another caption, for a picture of monkeys on the balustrade of St Paul&#8217;s Cathedral describes them as &#8220;a new breed of tropical immigrants reminiscing about equatorial days.</em></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>In a similar fashion Hannah Smith, also based at the Climate Outreach and Information Network, responded to the exhibition by arguing that:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><em>The actual patterns of migration are far more likely to be the movement of people inside existing national borders or, in the case of the UK, from within the European Union. To suggest that there will be mass migration from the [global] south is misleading and feeds xenophobia.</em></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>There are two aspects of this &#8216;migrant flood narrative&#8217; which are crucial.</p>
                  
                  <p>Firstly there is a determinist argument here that suggests that environmental change leads inextricably to social outcomes in ways that deny the material histories of colonialism, geopolitics, human movement and environmental vulnerability.</p>
                  
                  <p>Secondly, the figure of the climate migrant is typically cast as a threat to security, and normally to Western security.  In a recent article entitled: <a href=""http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=a45388"">&#8216;Racialisation and the figure of the climate-change migrant&#8217;</a>  the geographer Andrew Baldwin summarises some of the ways in which we might see in the thinking around of climate-induced migration the legacies of earlier models of environmental determinism. He argues:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><em>Migration is by now a standard element of climate-change discourse. However, its meaning within climate-change discourse is ever-shifting and open to continuous reconfiguration. It is prevalent, for instance, in accounts that frame climate change as a field of geopolitical security. In such accounts, the so-called &#8216;climate-change migrant&#8217; is commonly figured as a threat to various forms of security. &#8230; The thesis broadly holds that climate-change-induced migrations could result in outbreaks of violent conflict in places where resources are scarce. Here, the reasoning is that migrants will place additional demands on resources that are either already allocated or under severe pressure from degradation and overuse and, thus, come into conflict with preexisting resource users.</em></p>
                  
                    <p><em>Migration is also found in accounts that frame climate change as a humanitarian issue. In such accounts, the climate-change migrant is commonly figured as a victim of or vulnerable to climate change. This is the migrant-as-victim thesis, and one of its central narratives is that the migrant or potential migrant is at risk of losing his or her human-rights protections. In this version of the migrant-as-victim thesis, climate-change-induced migration is framed as a problem resolvable through better law.</em></p>
                  
                    <p><em>However, it is the dual construction of the migrant, as threat and victim, that should alert us to the presence of racial power within climate change and migration discourse. This is for two reasons. First, the labels &#8216;threat&#8217; and &#8216;victim&#8217; are what mark the migrant as different from some purportedly normal, unmarked body. And second, both authorise some form of moral intervention&#8212;whether increased policing or humanitarian assistance. In other words &#8230; the racial Other is conceived in the language of threat and victimhood and that its status as such is normally said to be a function of some innate quality rather than of its denied history or awkward positioning in anachronistic space.</em></p>

                  <p>In this step, Matthew introduces <em>An Ecomodernist Manifesto</em> &#8212; a statement penned by an influential group of environmental thinkers &#8212; as an example of a storytelling mechanism used to promote a particular narrative about humans and nature.</p>
                  
                  <p>The most powerful versions of the nature-culture dualism are the ones that are taken for granted and are simply implicit in environmental practices and politics.</p>
                  
                  <p>Occasionally, however, we are given a more explicit illustration of the nature-culture dualism.</p>
                  
                  <p>Take for example the recently released <a href=""http://www.ecomodernism.org"">An Ecomodernist Manifesto</a>.</p>
                  
                  <p>The manifesto is an intriguing read. It was written by a group of leading environmental thinkers including the author of the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Whole-Earth-Discipline-RestoredWildlands-Geoengineering/dp/B005DI7RJ6"">Whole Earth Discipline</a> Stuart Brand, renowned environmental commentator <a href=""http://www.marklynas.org/"">Mark Lynas</a> and the co-founders of the <a href=""http://www.thebreakthrough.org/"">Breakthrough Institute</a>, Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger.</p>
                  
                  <p>Of course as it is a manifesto, its <em>raison d&#8217;&#234;tre</em> is to be provocative. With its support for nuclear power, intensive agriculture and genetically modified crops &#8212; together with the suggestion that &#8220;<a href=""http://thebreakthrough.org/index.php/dialogue/can-we-have-a-good-anthropocene"">positive decoupling trends offer hope for a &#8216;good Anthropocene&#8217;</a>&#8221; &#8212; the manifesto certainly delivers. It questions many of the core issues that have galvanised contemporary environmental campaigns and concerns.</p>
                  
                  <p>It is worth thinking about how the manifesto works conceptually. Its central claim is that humans need to de-couple from nature. The authors open with a striking claim:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><em>We affirm one long-standing environmental ideal, that humanity must shrink its impacts on the environment to make more room for nature, while we reject another, that human societies must harmonise with nature to avoid economic and ecological collapse.</em> (p. 6)</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>In place of a notion of harmony or environmental balance &#8212; the kinds of ideas that have influenced environmental thinking for nearly forty years &#8212; the authors recommend that</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><em>intensifying many human activities &#8212; particularly farming, energy extraction, forestry, and settlement &#8212; so that they use less land and interfere less with the natural world is the key to decoupling human development from environmental impacts.</em> (p. 7)</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>Further into the manifesto the meaning of this notion of decoupling becomes clearer:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><em>Decoupling raises the possibility that societies might achieve peak human impact without intruding much further on relatively untouched areas. Nature unused is nature spared.</em> (p. 19)</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>This claim is perhaps one of the clearest expressions of the modernist concept of nature: that the intensification of human activities will enable humans to extricate themselves from relations with nature.</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>

                  <p>This week we looked at the power of storytelling in composing new natures.</p>
                  
                  <p>We provided examples of how storytelling can be used to promote different narratives &#8212; or representations of situations and events. We also encountered the recurring idea that telling stories draws us into new connections, accountabilities and obligations.</p>
                  
                  <p>You invented your own creative stories about the future through the Game of Global Futures, which further demonstrated the complexities and contingencies of environmental issues and illustrated how different connections, or coalescences, lead to different environmental outcomes.</p>
                  
                  <p>Finally, we invited you to examine the dominant narratives in your chosen issue. In preparation for your assignment next week, we also asked you to consider alternative narratives that align with the values you would like to see promoted within your issue.</p>
                  
                  <p>In Week 5, you will be encouraged to develop a &#8220;creative intervention&#8221; by drawing on reflections and activities from previous weeks.</p>
                  
                  <p>We encourage you to look at the list of optional further reading in the next step.</p>

                  <p>Creating tangible avenues for change, or what Judy refers to as motivating action, is perhaps one of the most important mechanisms through which nature can be re-made.</p>
                  
                  <p>Motivating action means doing more than just challenging existing narratives and proposing new ones; it involves actively conducting real-world initiatives &#8212; such as political activism, business ventures, economic interventions, urban development projects, systemic advocacy work, education and training programs, and awareness-raising &#8212; to tangibly restructure our relationship to the environment, often at the local or national level.</p>

                  <p>As we said at the beginning of this course, we want you to take an active role in your learning &#8212; to get out in the world and create change. Now that you have learned the basics and have seen some examples of creative interventions at work, it&#8217;s your turn to start designing your own intervention. Consider how you can take action, even on a small scale, to address an environmental issue that concerns you.</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <h2 id=""instructions""><strong>Instructions</strong></h2>
                  
                    <p>Your assignment is to plan a creative intervention into the environmental issue you chose in <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/remaking-nature/2/steps/119892"">Week 1</a> (or another environmental issue that interests you). The intervention could be a film project, social media campaign, artwork, piece of literature, website, business idea &#8212; the sky is the limit!</p>
                  
                    <p>Consider including the following in your plan:</p>
                  
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        <p><strong>What is your idea?:</strong> In five sentences or less, explain the scope of your intervention &#8212; What facts and values are involved in the issue? What will your intervention look like? How it will make a real difference? Consider what scale you will work at &#8212; local? global? &#8212; and how the intervention relates to the ideas we have been discussing in this course. What values will your intervention promote? How will it ask people to re-imagine or re-think things? Post your summary in the comments for this step to get feedback.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p><strong>Action steps:</strong> Make a list of the major tasks you will need to complete. For each task, list the resources you will require, the stakeholders involved, and a reasonable time frame for completion. Ensure your project will be achievable. If it&#8217;s not, then it&#8217;s time to go back to the drawing board. Also consider how it relates to the ideas we have discussed in this course. For example, is your intervention care-ful, and just? Is it based on a sound and comprehensive understanding of the issue? Is it situated? Does it align with the values of different stakeholders (including non-human stakeholders)?</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p><strong>Success criteria.</strong> In 2-3 sentences, explain how you will evaluate your intervention. What outcome would you consider a success? Share your success criteria in the comments for this step.</p>
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                  
                    <p>We are particularly interested in how your intervention relates to the ideas we have been discussing in this course. How will it ask people to re-imagine or re-think things? How might it remake nature?</p>
                  
                    <p>If the project you are imagining is quite large, you might use this assignment to develop a proposal or small pilot for your larger idea, or as a way of making the first steps towards developing your intervention &#8212; such as creating a storyboard, sketch or treatment.</p>

                  <p>Please use the comments for this step to support one another &#8212; to get preliminary feedback about your ideas, or to respond to the ideas of others. When you have posted your ideas, please provide constructive comments for at least one other post.

                  <p>We hope you have gained an appreciation of what work in the emerging field of Environmental Humanities can achieve and feel inspired to pursue other ways of getting involved in the remaking of natures.</p>
                  
                  <p>At the outset of this course we discussed the need to look beyond the natural sciences, beyond economics, to find solutions to our current environmental problems that are not only sustainable, but also creative, democratic and just.</p>
                  
                  <p>As teaching, research, activism and creative collaborations in the Environmental Humanities continue to expand we are developing a broad range of tools, interventions and approaches. This work is already making a dynamic contribution to a much larger environmental movement, while also drawing this movement into critical dialogue with various justice movements to work towards better futures for everyone.</p>
                  
                  <p>In participating in this course you will have noticed the broad transdisciplinarity of the Environmental Humanities. During the previous weeks we have drawn on research and approaches from subfields and disciplines including philosophy, art, history, anthropology and more.</p>
                  
                  <p>From a certain perspective then the label &#8220;environmental humanities&#8221; might be understood as an umbrella term: a gathering up of a range of distinct qualitative approaches to the environment. But this is not really the approach we have taken in this course. Instead, we have aimed to break down borders between these diverse fields, to mix together different methods of understanding, of communicating, of intervening, and in so doing to explore a genuinely transdisciplinary approach. It is through precisely this kind of transdisciplinarity that the humanities can contribute most powerfully &#8212; that is, critically and creatively &#8212; to the shaping of a better world.</p>
