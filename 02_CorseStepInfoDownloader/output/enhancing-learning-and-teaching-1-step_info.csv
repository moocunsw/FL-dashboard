                  <h3 id=""course-rationale"">Course rationale</h3>
                  
                  <p>This course is the third of three courses of the <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/programs/university-learning-and-teaching"">Foundations of University Learning and Teaching (FULT) program</a>. In <strong>this</strong> course we focus  on enhancement of learning and teaching through evaluation and reflection.</p>
                  
                  <p>The first course (Introduction to Learning and Teaching in Higher Education) focuses on student learning and teaching, identified in the presage component of the 3P model of learning diagram below (Biggs, 1993). The second course (Introduction to Educational Design in HIgher Education) focuses on curriculum and learning design, which is the process component of the 3P model.</p>
                  
                  <p>Even though each course has a different focus, you need to remember that we are looking at an educational system where each component is interrelated. A change in any one component of the system will result in disequilibrium and changes will be required as the system adapts to reach equilibrium again. For example, a change in students&#8217; prior knowledge will require a change in teaching, in the curriculum and in evaluation.</p>

                  <p>Each week has a similar structure that includes a step with an overview of the content and high level structure.</p>
                  
                  <p>In addition to the content, the &#8216;References&#8217; and &#8216;Want to know more&#8217; sections provide useful resources. The learning activities consists of - &#8216;Talking points&#8217;, &#8216;Reflection points&#8217; and &#8216;Evaluation toolkit examples&#8217;.</p>
                  
                  <p>As you progress through each week of the course, you will engage in a range of evaluation activities and resources - all of which will help you with application of an evaluation process in your practice and carry out a mini-evaluation task in week 4.</p>

                    <li>
                      <p><strong>References:</strong> In each step you will also find a list of useful references to supplement the content in the course. If you work for an educational institution you may have direct access to the resources, otherwise your local library might be able to help you access them.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Want to know more:</strong> We try to provide free and open resources as core readings and other references (in the &#8216;Want to know more&#8217; section) should be considered additional or optional resources which will be useful to get a more in-depth understanding of the topics and encourage you to go beyond the course.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Talking points:</strong> These are targeted questions which focus on the topics covered in that Step or Week. Engaging in discussion with other help you to gain a deeper learning experience through sharing your ideas with others from different discipline or professional contexts.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Reflection points:</strong> These are opportunities for you to stop and reflect independently.</p>

                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Quizzes:</strong>  At the end of each week will help to revise and consolidate your understanding of the week&#8217;s topic.</p>

                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Building your toolkit examples:</strong> At the end of each week we will demonstrate, or model, different ways to collect and collate feedback as evaluation data. Each activity is an example of a resource that builds your evaluation toolkit. We will also collect all the feedback received through these activities and provide you with the data so we can continue to  discuss the issues.This feedback will also be used by us to improve future versions of this course.</p>

                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Mini-evaluation task in Week 4:</strong> The mini-evaluation is where you apply what you learn to your own evaluation project. It is a key component of this course and it offers a unique opportunity for you to consider your practice systematically. In the first three weeks we cover concepts about evaluation, tools, sources and approaches and some definitions of student experience. This information will help you to think about, design and implement an evaluation of your practice.</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>It is &#8216;mini&#8217; because you will have limited time to consider what to evaluate, how to implement it and reflect on the findings. More information is available in step 1.13 and Week 4.</p>

                  <p>In this introductory week, we start the course with a focus on what we mean by the concept of evaluation. A practice that is closely related to, even integrated with, evaluation is that of reflection. And, we will explore the links between evaluative and reflective practices.</p>
                  
                  <p>Throughout the week, we encourage you to reflect on how the content relates to your educational context.</p>
                  
                  <p>In summary, this week we will cover three topics:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>What is evaluation and why it is needed for enhancing learning and teaching</li>
                    <li>Review and develop reflection and reflective practice</li>
                    <li>Think about how you can design and implement an evaluation in your context</li>

                  <p>In this course, which is part of the Foundations of University Learning and Teaching program, you have the option to develop an ePortfolio to support your development as a reflective practitioner by collecting evidence from the course activities and discussions.</p>
                  
                  <p>The ePortfolio is a required assessment task if you are intending to complete all three courses that make-up the Foundations of University Learning and Teaching program.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""purpose"">Purpose</h3>
                  <p>To help you develop connections between the program and your workplace. To link theory to practice through discussion and analysis of key issues that interest you and your peers. Your portfolio will be used in two ways:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>record your general reflections about teaching and learning during the course (not for submission)</li>
                    <li>complete the required portfolio activities drawing on your experiences during the program and copy these into the ePortfolio submission template provided at the bottom of the page (for submission in the <a href=""https://www.futurelearn.com/programs/university-learning-and-teaching/assessment"">Final Assessment course</a>. (Note: The headings in the PDF template can also be copied into an editable document for you to complete.)</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p><strong>Reflective practice</strong>: this documentation of reflection related to your own practice is for personal purposes, not for direct submission. Maintaining a record of your reflections will provide the information you need to write up your final portfolio task.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Peer sharing</strong>: although you won&#8217;t be directly required to submit these personal reflections we suggest it would be useful to share them with a peer to gain insight into different perspectives.
                  We have provided a peer review activity at the end of the course for you to share one of your portfolio tasks with your peers.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Collecting evidence</strong>: to complete the Foundations of University Learning and Teaching (FULT) program you will be asked to submit artefacts from your FULT learning, so it will be useful to collect and keep a copy of these as part of your reflection.</p>
                  
                  <p>These include:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>quotes from your reflective writing, or from the posts that have been critical in prompting your thinking;</li>
                    <li>references to readings and research that have influenced you;</li>
                    <li>lesson plans you have developed;</li>
                    <li>mini-evaluations your have undertaken and other forms such as images you have captured or created.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <h3 id=""reflecting-in-your-portfolio"">Reflecting in your portfolio</h3>
                  
                  <p>In writing your reflection you can:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>write brief notes or point form phrases</li>
                    <li>observe others and describe what you learn from them</li>
                    <li>listen to what your peers/colleagues have to say about issues that you raise for discussion and use the different perspectives to deepen your personal reflection</li>
                    <li>ask yourself &#8216;what&#8217; &#8216;why&#8217; and &#8216;how&#8217; questions to discover why a situation you experienced or observed could be a valuable stimulus for reflection and learning.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <h3 id=""eportfolio-activities-overall-length-3000-words"">ePortfolio activities (Overall length: 3000 words)</h3>

                  <p>To begin the course we first need to understand what evaluation means. There are many definitions of evaluation depending on the context and discipline, but most have a common thread.</p>
                  
                  <p>A common definition is:
                  <em>&#8220;The process of determining to what extent the educational objectives are actually being realized&#8221;</em> (Tyler, 1950, p. 69)</p>
                  
                  <p>Another accepted definition is:
                  <em>&#8220;Evaluation is the process of determining merit, worth, or significance; an evaluation is a product of that process&#8221;</em> (Scriven, 1991, p. 53)</p>
                  
                  <p>However, Cronbach and associates (1980) clearly rejected the judgmental nature of evaluation advocating an approach that recognises the evaluator as:
                  <em>&#8220;an educator [whose] success is to be judged by what others learn&#8221; (p. 11) rather than a &#8220;referee [for] a basketball game&#8221; (p. 18) who is hired to decide who is &#8220;right&#8221; or &#8220;wrong&#8221;.</em></p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <h3 id=""talking-point"">Talking point</h3>
                    <p>Time to vote.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <p>Think about the definitions of evaluation. Identify which is your favourite and post in the discussion with one sentence about why this definition resonates with you.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Use the &#8216;like&#8217; button to have your say too. You can click on &#8216;like&#8217; to vote on the your favourite definition and explanation. <em>You might have to revisit this talking point at a later stage to complete this.</em></p>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  
                  <p>Based on a review of the definitions, there are three key components of evaluation:</p>
                  
                  <ol>
                    <li>who is doing evaluation?</li>
                    <li>what is the purpose of the evaluation?</li>
                    <li>for whom the evaluation is done?</li>
                  </ol>
                  
                  <p>An assumption underpinning this course is that &#8216;evaluation is an analytical process that is intrinsic to good teaching&#8217; (Ramsden, 2003, p. 209).</p>
                  
                  <p>In the educational evaluation context, Nevo (1983) suggested ten questions to drive the discussion/review of what evaluation entails.</p>
                  
                  <p>These ten questions can provide a scaffold for you to consider in planning your mini-evaluation which is one of the main activities for this course.</p>
                  
                  <ol>
                    <li>How is evaluation defined?</li>
                    <li>What are the functions of evaluation?</li>
                    <li>What are the objects of evaluation?</li>
                    <li>What kinds of information should be collected regarding each object</li>
                    <li>What criteria should be used to judge the merit and worth of an evaluated object?</li>
                    <li>Who should be served by an evaluation?</li>
                    <li>What is the process of doing an evaluation?</li>
                    <li>What methods of inquiry should be used in evaluation?</li>
                    <li>Who should do evaluation?</li>
                    <li>By what standards should evaluation be judged?</li>
                  </ol>

                  <p>Now that we have a better understanding of what evaluation means, in this step we will look at the role it plays in enhancing curriculum.</p>
                  
                  <p>The ways to gather evidence for quality enhancement through evaluation depends on what you plan to do, or to use the words from Nevo&#8217;s (1983) 10 questions, the function and objects of your evaluation. For example, to evaluate the effectiveness of a particular teacher, you may want to consider students&#8217; experience in context (i.e. in the class, or over a number of classes). Direct feedback from students could be useful in this case. If the focus is on what students&#8217; learnt from a particular session or a course, a specific quiz/assessment might be more useful.</p>
                  
                  <p>The role of evaluation in enhancing curriculum can be viewed as cyclical (George &amp; Cowan, 2004) 
                  where the aims of the curriculum (or the learning outcomes) are at the centre and interact with all the aspects of curriculum design.</p>
                  
                  <p>In this version, evaluation is a specific step with clear dependencies to the learning outcomes (in the center of the figure) and the learning outcomes drive all the stages of learning design. Each step has its own loop in which evaluation can play a formative or key role before decisions are made.</p>

                  <p>In general terms, and similarly to what we do with the assessment of students, evaluations to improve teaching design and your practice are referred to as formative evaluation, while evaluations used in making decisions (for example, for purposes of promotion) are referred to as summative evaluations of teaching effectiveness.</p>
                  
                  <p>In week 2 we will introduce a new three-step integrative framework to guide you through the process of evaluation. This framework integrates different approaches to academic development and professional development, models of reflective practice and recent applications related to educational data mining and learning analytics. The three-step framework will give you a structure and approach with which you can undertake your mini-evaluation.</p>
                  
                  <p>As there are many models of evaluation available to help you plan and structure an evaluation, here we introduce you to three different models or resources. Each model or resource offers a different approach to understanding and undertaking evaluation.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id=""the-evaluation-cookbook"">The Evaluation Cookbook</h4>
                  <p>A great place to start is the &#8216;cookbook&#8217; developed by the Learning Technology Dissemination Initiative in Scotland. It is a practical guide aimed at lecturers and educational professionals interested in evaluating materials for their effectiveness in achieving specific learning objectives. The set of &#8216;recipes&#8217; by evaluation experts, presents a comprehensive review of the methods that can be used as well as example of applications.</p>
                  
                  <p>The cookbook is available for you to <a href=""http://www.icbl.hw.ac.uk/ltdi/cookbook/cookbook.pdf"">download</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id=""the-cipp-evaluation-model"">The CIPP Evaluation Model</h4>
                  <p>CIPP Evaluation Model (Stufflebeam, 2004) is a comprehensive framework developed over a decade of research into project evaluation by internationally recognised leaders of evaluation.</p>
                  
                  <p>The acronym CIPP represents:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>Context - What needs to be done?</li>
                    <li>Input - How should it be done?</li>
                    <li>Process - Is it being done?</li>
                    <li>Product evaluation - Did it succeed? For example: impact, effectiveness, sustainability, and transportability.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>Originally the CIPP was used mainly to evaluate the impact of the introduction of learning technology but it is now used across the education sector.</p>
                  
                  <p>To explain product evaluation in the context of evaluating learning technology:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>impact assesses whether the deployment of ICT facilities in teaching and learning has a direct effect on the lecturers and students, what the effects are and whether other aspects of the system change as a result of the development or implementation</li>
                    <li>effectiveness checks whether the programme achieves the intended and unintended benefits, or whether it is effective for the purpose of improved teaching and learning for which it was designed.</li>
                    <li>transportability measures whether the changes in teaching and learning and its improved effects can be directly attributed or associated to the deployment of ICT.</li>
                    <li>sustainability considers the lasting effects of the ICT deployment on the students and lecturers and how well they utilise and maintain it for teaching and learning purposes.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <h4 id=""altc-project-evaluation-resource"">ALTC Project Evaluation Resource</h4>
                  <p>This <a href=""http://www.olt.gov.au/system/files/resources/Project_Evaluation_Resource.pdf"">evaluation resource</a> developed by Chesterton and Cummings (2011) is specifically designed for:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>learning and teaching, and</li>
                    <li>the Australian higher education sector.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>This ten step resource provides clear questions to frame each step as well as details of each step. While the resource was originally developed for projects funded by a national body, it is relevant to any proposed evaluation to be undertaken in learning and teaching. The ten steps are:</p>
                  
                  <ol>
                    <li>Project clarification: What is the nature of the project?</li>
                    <li>What is the purpose and scope of the evaluation?</li>
                    <li>Who are the stakeholders for the project and the audiences for the evaluation information?</li>
                    <li>What are the key evaluation questions which the evaluation will address?</li>
                    <li>How will the information be collected and analysed?</li>
                    <li>What are the criteria for making judgments about the findings of the evaluation?</li>
                    <li>What resources and skills are required to conduct the evaluation?</li>
                    <li>How will the evaluation findings be disseminated?</li>
                    <li>What is the timeline for the evaluation activities?</li>
                    <li>Is the evaluation plan internally coherent and of high quality?</li>
                  </ol>

                  <p>Reflection and evaluation are two separate, but related concepts.</p>
                  
                  <p><em>Reflection</em> is the process of reflecting on your experience in order to learn from that experience.</p>
                  
                  <p><em>Evaluation</em> is the process of making an assessment or judgement about an experience or a person.</p>
                  
                  <p>It is possible to reflect on an experience, especially when reflecting at a shallow (recount or report) level, without evaluating that experience. It is difficult (but not impossible) to evaluate an experience without reflecting on that experience (Johnson, 2015).</p>
                  
                  <p>Here is an example:</p>
                  
                  <p><em>Evaluation</em></p>
                  
                  <p>All students (100%) in my class used the video annotation tool.</p>
                  
                  <p><em>Reflection</em></p>
                  
                  <p>The novelty, together with the user-friendly functionality, of the video annotation tool engaged all my students.</p>
                  
                  <p><em>Reflective lenses</em></p>
                  
                  <p>In the first course, Introduction to Learning and Teaching in Higher Education, we introduced Brookfield&#8217;s (1995a) four lenses for reflective practice:
                  1. self-lense or autobiography
                  2. the lense of students 
                  3. the lense of peers
                  4. the lense of the research literature.</p>
                  
                  <p>We suggest you use all four reflective lenses as you develop your ePortfolio for the FULT program.</p>
                  
                  <p>Reflection on your teaching or educational practice is a form of evaluation and we will continue to explore this in detail in this course.</p>
                  
                  <p><em>When can you reflect?</em></p>
                  
                  <p>Reflection can be done during a teaching session or after the session.</p>
                  
                  <p><em>Reflection in action</em></p>
                  
                  <p>Reflection can take place while you are in the act of teaching or supporting the teaching role. As an educator you are working towards putting into action the theory of your discipline with the theory of pedagogy. Reflection in action can support you to make real-time decisions about what is the best practice for your context while also evaluating that practice. You could do this by taking down quick reflective points to use as prompts for later reflection on action. (Sch&#246;n, 1987)</p>
                  
                  <p><em>Reflection on action</em></p>
                  
                  <p>Reflection on action takes places after the act of teaching or supporting teaching. This refers to reviewing and evaluating past actions in order to learn from those actions and then apply the learning to future actions. Many models and tools are available to support this reflection, for example, a &#8216;critical incident&#8217; (Brookfield, 1995b)  may have occurred that prompts or challenges your thinking and this can be a strong prompt for reflective practice.(Sch&#246;n, 1987)</p>
                  
                  <p><em>How can you reflect?</em></p>
                  
                  <p>There are many models that can be used for reflective practice.</p>
                  
                  <p><em>Three step process (Boud, Keogh &amp; Walker, 1985)</em></p>
                  
                  <ol>
                    <li>Returning to the experience &#8211; recalling and/or detailing significant events</li>
                    <li>Attending to feelings &#8211; being aware of how the situation felt. Be aware of emotions that are useful, and try not ignore feelings which might be troublesome or painful such as fear or disappointment.</li>
                    <li>Evaluating the experience &#8211; this involves re-examining the experience in the light of what you already know and what you intended for the experience and integrating new knowledge.</li>
                  </ol>
                  
                  <p><em>Six stage model</em></p>
                  
                  <p>Gibbs (1988) developed a simple, idealised six stage model of the iterative process of reflection through which the reflective learner progresses cyclically.</p>
                  
                  <p>More information about this is available <a href=""https://www.brookes.ac.uk/students/upgrade/study-skills/reflective-writing-gibbs/"">here</a>.</p>

                  <p><em>Systematic observation and appraisal</em></p>
                  
                  <p>Systematic observation and appraisal are the two common features between evaluation of, and reflection on, one&#8217;s experiences.</p>
                  
                  <p>The analytical process involved in systematic reflection (and reflective writing) on teaching is similar to critical appraisal and reporting that you might do in a research study.</p>
                  
                  <p>A simple way to start reflecting about your teaching practice, with an evaluative perspective, is to consider a few simple questions:</p>
                  
                  <table>
                    <thead>
                      <tr>
                        <th>Why?</th>
                        <th>What worked well?</th>
                      </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                      <tr>
                        <td>Why not?</td>
                        <td>What did not work well?</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td>So what?</td>
                        <td>What will I do the same next time?</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td>Now what?</td>
                        <td>What will I do differently next time?</td>
                      </tr>
                    </tbody>
                  </table>
                  
                  <p>If you start thinking about your teaching or educational role in a systematic way and consider your role in the evaluation process, then you might also ask yourself more specific questions:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>what knowledge, skills or abilities are necessary to deliver a specific learning experience?</li>
                    <li>to what extent do I possess those skills?</li>
                    <li>what do I need to do to develop or enhance those skills?</li>
                    <li>how will this affect the way I present that learning experience?</li>
                    <li>what problems might this entail that I need to anticipate and overcome?</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>These are useful starting points in considering your development as an educator and your career progression.</p>

                  <p>A key component of this course involves you undertaking a mini-evaluation task related to learning and teaching. The mini-evaluation is where you apply what you learn to your own evaluation project. More information is available in Week 4.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""overview"">Overview</h3>
                  
                  <p>As a key component of this course, it offers a unique opportunity for you to consider your practice systematically. You will be able to select a relevant approach to evaluation, share your process and experience, discuss the outcomes, issues you faced, and how what you have learned will affect your future practice and your context.</p>
                  
                  <p>It is &#8216;mini&#8217; because you will have limited time to consider what to evaluate, how to implement it and reflect on the findings. That means you need to be realistic about what you can do within the timeframe. We strongly encourage you to choose a relatively specific aspect or domain and carefully create questions that can be achieved within the time allotted.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""how-does-the-mini-evaluation-work"">How does the mini-evaluation work?</h3>
                  
                  <p>In the first three weeks we cover concepts about evaluation, tools, sources and approaches and some definitions of student experience. This information will help you to think about, design and implement an evaluation of your practice in Week 4.</p>
                  
                  <p>It is time to start thinking about what you may want to evaluate. The scope for what you evaluate is very broad, for example: ranging from some aspect of your teaching or learning strategies, curriculum design, content or resources, in face-to-face, blended or online contexts.</p>
                  
                  <p>You only have a short time to do the evaluation. A model that outlines the evaluation process will be introduced next week. Steps to support you for the evaluation process will be detailed in week 4.</p>
                  
                  <p>If you have questions or doubts, please use the discussion below to share your thoughts.</p>

                  <p>In the first week, we looked at what is evaluation and the role of evaluation and reflection in enhancing learning and teaching in higher education. Once you have decided to evaluate your practice, you need to narrow down to a specific aspect of your teaching or educational design, and work out how to carry out the evaluation.</p>
                  
                  <p>Our focus this week is on:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>your perspectives (or position) of evaluation</li>
                    <li>data sources for evaluation with a focus on the sources of feedback (or lenses)</li>
                    <li>methods to collect data that will inform evaluation (that you will practice when undertaking your own evaluation)</li>
                    <li>the conceptualisation that feedback is data and what the role of such data is in the evaluative process.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>The process of systematic evaluation is core to the practice of enhancing learning and teaching in higher education. To help work out how to evaluate, you need to ask yourself these questions:</p>
                  
                  <ol>
                    <li>What is the purpose of evaluation (what are the key questions)?</li>
                    <li>Who are the stakeholders?</li>
                    <li>What are the most appropriate sources of evidence?</li>
                    <li>What is the most appropriate methodology to answer your questions?</li>
                  </ol>
                  
                  <p>We will reconsider the &#8216;what&#8217; and &#8216;who&#8217; questions in more detail in week 4 and week 5 respectively.</p>
                  
                  <p>The last two questions can be considered the &#8216;how to&#8217; carry out an evaluation and are what we cover this week.</p>

                  <p>You&#8217;ve probably come across different perspectives on how to conduct an objective evaluation. Here are two perspectives:</p>
                  
                  <p><em>Perspective 1</em></p>
                  
                  <p>An established perspective argues that evaluation should strive to maintain objectivity so that &#8220;the claims, methods and results of science [evaluation] are not, or should not be influenced by particular perspectives, value commitments, community bias or personal interests, to name a few relevant factors.&#8220; (Reiss &amp; Sprenger, 2014, para 1).</p>
                  
                  <p><em>Perspective 2</em></p>
                  
                  <p>&#8220;There is no such thing as objective evaluation.&#8221;</p>

                  <p>In practice there is almost no limit to how you can approach evaluation. Indeed, the evaluation process works best if it is designed to respond to the needs of your personal educational context. 
                  To make sure your evaluation is effective in enhancing your practice, the next step is to develop a &#8216;how to&#8217; plan.</p>
                  
                  <p>Here is a simplified version of a framework to give your plan a structure.</p>

                  <p>In this first stage you need to decide where you stand in respect to key questions that shape any evaluation:</p>
                  
                  <ol>
                    <li>what is the purpose of evaluation (what are the key questions?)</li>
                    <li>who the stakeholders are</li>
                    <li>what is the most appropriate methodology to answer your questions (how)</li>
                    <li>what are the most appropriate sources of evidence (how)</li>
                  </ol>
                  
                  <p>Your  conscious choices in response to these questions will affect the evaluation process as well as the conclusions which you will be able to draw from the evaluation.</p>
                  
                  <p>Your position will be shaped by:</p>
                  
                  <ol>
                    <li>the questions you ask</li>
                    <li>your level of engagement in the process</li>
                    <li>the sources of data you collect.</li>
                  </ol>
                  
                  <p>Your level of engagement in the evaluation process can be represented as a continuum ranging from little engagement (at the periphery), to that of an inside observer and then to an in-depth engagement (at the core).</p>
                  
                  <p>Emerging from the academic development work of the authors and the reflections in submitted work they have assessed through the years, the following metaphors were suggested as <em>typical</em> examples of how the positions are related to the second stage of the model, focusing on the selection of interpretational lenses and the sources of data.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Second-hand data: &#8216;gold panning&#8217;</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>Focus is entirely on the design of the course and the teaching of the material. There is no conscious intention of asking specific questions about the effectiveness of the design and therefore success stories are like golden nuggets, which are found occasionally, more for persistence and refinement of the technique.  If any, the data collection relies on students or peer feedback and/or self reflection.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>At the periphery: the astronomer</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>Awareness of the reporting tools available, exploring the data as a by-product of the teaching process while becoming accustomed to considering a range of sources of evidence, taking different perspectives to appraise teaching effectiveness. The sense-making afforded by the use of the data is like the observation of a distant planet, something that happens outside their direct control.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Inside observer: the ethnographer</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>Actively part of the process, data generated doesn&#8217;t flow from a distance; it is actively collected to gain objectivity from the observation of teaching. Hence, the data becomes a tool to understand the process of teaching and its effectiveness on student learning alongside one&#8217;s own reflection.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Research at the core: the researcher/scientist</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>Questions and hypotheses actively drive the course design and data collection process. Appropriate &#8216;sensors&#8217; are used to measure aspects of teaching and learning and the design of the learning experience is fully informed by an hypotheses-driven testing cycle, constantly striving to learn from practice, from multiple perspectives and improve future iterations of course design and teaching. What is learned is then compared and analysed with existing evidence and theory for further dissemination.</p>

                  <h3 id=""lenses-and-perspectives"">Lenses and perspectives</h3>
                  <p>The use of lenses has been covered in the first course of this program: Introduction to Learning and Teaching in HIgher Education. You will be provided with additional information about lenses and sources of feedback in step 2.7.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""data-sources"">Data sources</h3>
                  <p>How you choose the source and the way you gather data depends on:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>your level of engagement</li>
                    <li>the types of resources available -  including the time and effort you can commit</li>
                    <li>the expected value - for details refer to the evaluation <a href=""http://www.icbl.hw.ac.uk/ltdi/cookbook/cookbook.pdf"">cookbook</a>.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>For example, some ways to collect data  are easy to implement, but then may require more effort when analysing data to extract needed information. A <strong><em>critical incident analysis</em></strong> will give you very rich feedback from students, but may be harder to analyse and summarise; a <strong><em>peer observation</em></strong> will provide very useful, contextual advice for your practice, but is hard to quantify; a <strong><em>well-designed survey</em></strong> will provide a good overview of students&#8217; opinions, but may not be detailed enough to pinpoint issues.</p>
                  
                  <p>The choice of the data sources can also be classified in a similar way to the position you can adopt as an evaluator. For example some data streams will come to you with no effort such as the  end of semester evaluations, informal student feedback, analytics in learning platforms used in your context. Other sources will require careful and explicit design such as  a survey to find out more about the effectiveness of a new tool/method you introduced, or a focus-group to gather students&#8217; opinions about an aspect of your course.</p>
                  
                  <p>When deciding on  the  methods and sources, you also need to be aware  of the relation between them. For example if you are used to sophisticated quantitative analysis, you may tend to pick particular methods which rely on the collection and analysis of quantitative data. You need to  weigh up the reasons why you think a method or source is important or more relevant to help you answer the questions you have articulated. In all cases, having multiple sources will give you a better understanding than a single method or source alone.</p>

                  <p>Traditionally, in the context of higher education there are three main sources of feedback available for evaluation of your teaching:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>Students</li>
                    <li>Colleagues</li>
                    <li>Yourself (reviewing your teaching)</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>A good example that explains sources of feedback comes from Brookfield (1995) who suggested that when teachers evaluate their practice they should look at themselves through four lenses; these include the three sources above and a fourth lens for reflection (theory) which is found in educational research / literature. The four lenses were introduced in the course Introduction to learning and teaching in higher education.</p>

                  <p>Now that you have collected your data, the next step is to integrate, interpret and reflect on these findings. To successfully integrate in an analytical way, educators need to put themselves at the core of the evaluation process and drive the process with questions and active reflection.</p>
                  
                  <p>This stage can be done at a range of depths and critique. For example, as an evaluator you could adopt an analytical approach, or combine an analytical approach with a critically reflective one.</p>
                  
                  <p>The challenge is to interpret the findings and critically reflect on what you learn from them and what they imply for your future actions.</p>
                  
                  <p>A crucial element is to shift from observation (collection and reporting phases in the analytical cycle presented earlier) to action (the prediction informed by the analysis of evidence and the refinement of practice modeled data).</p>
                  
                  <p>This shift informs the continuous improvement of practice and ultimately may lead to enhancement.</p>
                  
                  <p>However enhancement is not always the aim: sometimes this could be the by-product of the purposeful application of the analytical cycle which provides better insights and inform refinements.</p>
                  
                  <p>When you write up your mini-evaluation at the end of this course in weeks four and five you will be engaging in Stage 3 of the framework. That is, you will be integrating and interpreting your findings from your mini-evaluation and reflecting on the findings to identify your key learnings.</p>

                  <p>In this second week we focussed on how to evaluate. You were introduced to a three-step framework that will help structure your mini-evaluation.</p>
                  
                  <p>We also explored your perspectives (or position) of evaluation, data sources for evaluation with a focus on the sources of feedback (or lenses), methods to collect data and conceptualisations of feedback as data and the role of such data in the evaluative process.</p>
                  
                  <p>In Week 3 we  focus  on ways of defining what is meant by student experience and how it may be measured. We will ask you to situate the student experience in your context and examine ways of measuring aspects of the student experience including effectiveness of methods and tools for evaluation.</p>

                  <p>This week we look at ways of defining what is meant by student experience and we discuss how the student experience can be measured.</p>
                  
                  <p>Students are key stakeholders in higher education. Some argue that they are merely users of a service (i.e. education) and should be treated as consumers (Pate, 1993), others focus on the fundamental value of the learning experience and put them at the centre (Dewey, 1938; Radloff et al. 2011), ensuring that they take some of the responsibility in the learning process and even partner in the co-design of the curriculum (Cook-Sather, Bovill &amp; Felten, 2014).</p>
                  
                  <p>An understanding of what is meant with student experience provides a better position to design evaluations that can feed into the quality process for enhancing learning and teaching.</p>
                  
                  <p>The focus for this week will be:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>Definition of terms and the conceptual overview of the student experience</li>
                    <li>Situate the student experience in your context</li>
                    <li>Compare and contrast ways of measuring aspects of the student experience</li>
                    <li>Discuss the effectiveness of different methods and tools for evaluation.</li>

                  <p>We start this week with a focus on concepts. Defining the concept of student experience can be difficult as the terms used to refer to the &#8216;experience&#8217; in the literature are inconsistent.</p>
                  
                  <p>Typically, you will find four terms used in the literature: student experience, student engagement, student satisfaction and student evaluation of teaching.</p>
                  
                  <p>What are your definitions of these four concepts?</p>
                  
                  <p>Using the link in this step, please enter your answers. Once you have entered your definitions you will be able to see a list of the last 25 definitions entered by others for each concept/domain. 
                  We also provided a &#8216;word cloud&#8217; for each definition, which may help you to summarise and make sense of these definitions.</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Is there a simple definition?</li>
                      <li>If you take 5-10 definitions under a specific concept (for example student engagement), can you propose a single meaningful definition with no overlap with other concepts?</li>

"3.3","Factors affecting the student experience","Article","","","Week 3","2017-05-01","1 May","Week 3: Evaluating student experience","https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/enhancing-learning-and-teaching/1/steps/185414","[<div class=""a-text-context a-text-context--bold-intro"">
                  <p>In the last step, we asked you to articulate your definitions of each of four frequently used terms referring to the student experience. 
                  We invite you now to adopt a holistic approach when thinking about the student experience and consider the factors affecting experience as well as the cautious use of terms we identified earlier.</p>
                  
                  <p>&#8220;(&#8230;) we can never assume that the impact of teaching on student learning is what we expect it to be. Students&#8217; thoughts and actions are profoundly affected by the educational context or environment in which they learn. (&#8230;) Good teaching involves striving continually to learn about students&#8217; understanding and the effect of teaching on it&#8221;. (Ramsden, 1992, p. 6).</p>
                  
                  <p>The concept of student experience is complex. It has been discussed since the 1930s (by Dewey, 1938) and has received renewed interest in recent years. The current focus is on a broader representation of what it means for a student to be a student and the experience associated with earning a university qualification.</p>
                  
                  <p>Many factors affect the student experience. Some are directly related to learning and teaching, while others have to do with life beyond the class. All affect the way students experience learning and influence their level of satisfaction.</p>
                  
                  <p>When thinking about the student experience at university we need to think beyond teaching and transmitting or receiving information.</p>
                  
                  <p>Factors affecting the contemporary student experience include:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>large increases in student numbers e.g. in Australia from 1 million in 2008, to over 1.4 million in 2015, (DET 2008, 2015), or in the UK over 2.25 million (HESA, 2015-16),</li>
                    <li>student fees and HE funding models</li>
                    <li>admission standards</li>
                    <li>evolving issues around equity</li>
                    <li>internationalisation (James, French &amp; Kelly, 2017)</li>
                    <li>blended and distance education.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>More specifically, the methods of teaching shape the way student engage with learning and teaching. For example, it is legitimate to question whether the traditional face-to-face teaching is equivalent to new modes like blended or fully online.</p>
                  
                  <p>As another example, now that university fees are becoming a long-term investment/debt for students, the student as consumer has gained greater importance. This has got repercussions about what students actually expect from the educational experiences offered by universities and the way universities cater for learners.</p>
                  
                  <p>These explain why we now have changing perceptions about the student experience beyond satisfaction with teaching, which can be understood by taking a holistic perspective.</p>

                    <h3 id=""talking-point"">Talking point</h3>
                    <p>Several factors have been identified as affecting the student experience. In your context, identify one factor you have observed as having an effect on the student experience and in one sentence explain how it affects the student experience.</p>

                  <p>When we take an holistic and a student-centred approach to thinking about the student experience, we need to recognise that the process of studying and learning at university is not only about gaining  theoretical knowledge and transferable skills. Student experience is also connected with issues of personal growth and social development, both of which can have a positive influence on students&#8217; academic training or experience (Barnett, 1992).</p>
                  
                  <p>Taking inspiration from the list of perspective suggested by Baird &amp; Gordon (2009) the student experience can be conceptualised in a variety of ways:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>&#8216;All life experiences of all students while they are students&#8217;: This is including the experience (in general terms) of all students learning in an institution.</li>
                    <li>&#8216;All experiences of an individual while a student, which includes wider life experiences&#8217;. This refers specifically to the experience of one student, but includes everything that happens to them during their studies.</li>
                    <li>&#8216;All experiences of an individual student while in their identity as student&#8217;. This refers to the experience of an individual student while they are students (i.e. it will not include their other life experiences such as a part-time job, or performing sports, hobbies etc.)</li>
                    <li>&#8216;The experience of facets of university experienced by a student&#8217;: This means that the focus is on specific elements such as teaching, support, facilities etc.; however, it allows to analyse identifiable features of the experience associated with a clear sense of belonging to the institution.</li>
                    <li>The &#8216;consumer&#8217; view of experience, in which aspects of the services provided are considered (for example administrative procedures, catering, accommodation, IT etc).</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>While all these are based on the idea that student experience can be captured, either as a concept, or based on what individuals or the whole student population experience, others argues that we can not identify the student experience as a holistic or universal concept.</p>
                  
                  <p><em>&#8220;Student experience(s) are unique for each individual, across the range of contexts through which students engage as part of their university studies: there is no such thing as the student experience.&#8221;</em> (Radloff, Coates, James, &amp; Krause,  2011, p. 35)</p>
                  
                  <p>In fact, even for students registered in different degree programs within the same institution, it is common that students experience completely different patterns of teaching and assessment that determine the nature of their interactions and perception of their respective environments.</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <h3 id=""reflection-point"">Reflection point</h3>
                    <p><em>To move beyond perspectives and to look at what student experience means in practice, we need to consider the common goals that characterise all students deciding to enrol on a university course at a particular institution.</em></p>
                  
                    <p>Three common goals for students are:</p>
                  
                    <ul>
                      <li>personal development and transformation through learning</li>
                      <li>direct future benefits in terms of employability, social standing and contributions to society and communities</li>
                      <li>a match or fit between the student and the university in terms of areas of study or institutional/ departmental culture (i.e. becoming a professional: a doctor, a lawyer, a scientist etc.).</li>

                  <p>Through a process of strategic planning, universities work to identify and shape their vision of what type of student experience they offer. 
                  Each higher education institution aims to differentiate the unique elements which are part of their students&#8217; experience. Having identified a unique student experience for the institution, it would next be necessary to plan an evaluation that enables the institution to measure the attainment of its intended student experience.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Case example:</strong> <em>UNSW Scientia Educational Experience</em></p>
                  
                  <p>With the introduction of the <a href=""https://www.2025.unsw.edu.au/"">2025 Strategy</a>, UNSW has conceptualised the student experience as <a href=""https://teaching.unsw.edu.au/unsw-scientia-educational-experience"">the Scientia Student Experience</a> to differentiate the unique elements which are part of a UNSW student&#8217;s experience.</p>
                  
                  <p>UNSW has framed the student experience with four principles:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>Communities</li>

                  <h3 id=""why-use-student-evaluation-surveys"">Why use student evaluation surveys?</h3>
                  
                  <p>As educators, we need to know our students so that we can best design a curriculum that scaffolds and develops their learning. We already considered the idea of multiple sources of feeedback and the fact that, relying on one perspective (for example the reflective lens of the educator) may not provide us with a full or holistic understanding of the student experience.</p>
                  
                  <p>Educators were taken by surprise with the results of research by Arum and Roksa. In their book, <em>Academically Adrift</em>, (2011) the authors found that almost half of American students demonstrate no significant improvement in higher order cognitive skills such as critical thinking during their first two years at college. The surprising results of this research suggests that educators did not have a full understanding of their students&#8217; learning.</p>
                  
                  <p>A very common way to make sense of student experience is through the use of student surveys. Numerous studies have shown that feedback based on students&#8217; actual experiences of a course and the teaching can provide valuable insights into the perceived effectiveness of their learning and teaching environment. To improve our teaching, and for students to have a good learning experience, the most useful way to think of student evaluation surveys is not as an administrative necessity, but as an opportunity for critical reflection and for engaging in productive dialogue with students and peers.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>What is contained in student evaluation of teaching?</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>Students are asked to indicate their satisfaction with aspects of courses and teaching that have been shown by numerous research studies to create an environment that is conducive to student learning.</p>
                  
                  <p>These aspects may include:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>effective communication&#8212;the clarity with which ideas, concepts, goals and expectations (including those relating to assessment) are explained and communicated to students</li>
                    <li>the capacity to stimulate students&#8217; interest in a subject and to foster a desire and willingness to learn</li>
                    <li>encouragement of student participation and cooperative learning</li>
                    <li>the capacity to facilitate understanding and the development of critical-thinking and problem-solving skills</li>
                    <li>encouragement of independent learning</li>
                    <li>provision of high-quality feedback to students (UNSW, 2016).</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>Student survey data are an example of an evaluative data source which represents Stage 2 of the <strong>simplified 3 stage integrated teaching development framework</strong> (Vigentini, Negin &amp; Kligyte, 2016) and an example of the lens of the student as per Brookfield&#8217;s (1995) four lenses.</p>

                  <p>Student surveys (of which student evaluation of teaching is one example) have been around for a long time and are often controversial. 
                  Arguments and research both support and challenge the validity of survey results. An understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of student surveys is necessary so you can mitigate for weaknesses and make best use of the evaluative data generated.</p>
                  
                  <p>Summative evaluations of teaching effectiveness (for example, end of course student evaluations of teaching) are particularly controversial: during the 1980s and 90s there was a very heated debate about the validity, effectiveness and the value of students&#8217; evaluation of teaching (SET) which continues today.</p>
                  
                  <p>Over time, scholars agreed that while data provided in formal student feedback (such as the end of semester evaluations) is reliable, it does not directly measure the effectiveness of teaching, hence the validity is arguable.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""the-argument-for-surveys"">The argument <em>for</em> surveys</h3>
                  
                  <p>UNSW is committed to student surveys for collecting evaluative data on the student experience as evidenced by the <a href=""https://teaching.unsw.edu.au/surveys"">UNSW Student Surveys Project</a>.</p>
                  
                  <p>Merlin Crossley (Deputy Vice-Chancellor Education, UNSW) presents his argument about &#8216;<a href=""http://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/general/student-surveys-point-good-teaching-and-ways-be-better"">Student surveys point to good teaching and ways to be better</a>&#8217;.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""the-argument-against-surveys"">The argument <em>against</em> surveys</h3>
                  
                  <p>&#8220;&#8230;standardised teaching evaluations encourage lecturers [educators] to focus on the narrow range of outcomes that are measurable, on style rather than substance, to minimise the discomfort of reducing contentious readings and watering down substance to produce &#8216;thin&#8217; pedagogies&#8221; (Blackmore, 2009, p. 858).</p>
                  
                  <p>Linking back to the discussion on both the definitions of concepts related to the student experience and the factors affecting student experience, it is common that instruments like surveys rarely measure the worth of experience. The questions asked are more likely to focus on the satisfaction on aspects of the experience or, the engagement with learning and teaching.</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <h3 id=""talking-point"">Talking point</h3>
                    <p>Think about student surveys and their role in generating evaluation data. Do you believe that student survey data offers benefits or disadvantages for enhancing learning and teaching practice?

                  <p>A good starting point is to &#8216;position&#8217; yourself as an authentic evaluator (Stage 1). Orient yourself to this role, focus on the learning and teaching issue you would like to focus on.</p>
                  
                  <p>This positioning will support you in undertaking a &#8220;systematic, analytical investigation of the interactions between learning and teaching&#8221; (Vigentini, Negin &amp; Kligyte, 2016, pp. 11-12).</p>

                    <p><em>Reflect on your teaching or educational role. Identify an area of your practice that is problematic or that you would like to change. Think about a specific aspect that you would like to enhance, or improve. Position yourself as an evaluator. This process also aligns with that of SoTL - the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning. Likewise, engaging in SoTL starts with identifying an idea or question of &#8220;how student learning might be enhanced&#8221; (Trigwell, 2012).</em></p>

                  <h3 id=""take-time-to-explain"">Take time to explain</h3>
                  
                  <p>If you plan to collect data from students or have a colleague observing you, make sure that you explain what you are planning to do and why. This is often not communicated clearly to students and might lead to disengagement (i.e. &#8216;oh, another survey to fill in&#8230;&#8217;).</p>
                  
                  <p>If you take the time to explain to your students that you would like them to help you with a small evaluation exercise, which you are doing as part of a FutureLearn FULT  course, in many cases students will change their perceptions of you and what you are doing, and may appreciate that you are taking steps to develop as a teacher. A simple explanation will often lead to richer responses and useful feedback.</p>
                  
                  <p>If you decide to undertake a peer evaluation of your teaching, you should find the experience insightful. Once again, explain to your students that you are completing a FutureLearn course and ask them whether it is ok if your peer is sitting in and observing the class.</p>
                  
                  <p>After the evaluation activity, make sure that you close the feedback loop and communicate to your students the outcomes of the evaluation and how you are going to act on them.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""data-analysis"">Data analysis</h3>
                  
                  <p>If you decide on the option of an analysis of existing data, you will need to make sense of the available data and make sure that you put the data in context. For example, if you were using Moodle (a learning management system) data, if the course is fully online, all the interactions between students, the material and the instructors will be logged in the system, however, in a &#8216;blended-learning&#8217; situation, the data is only telling a part of the story.</p>
                  
                  <p>Finally, if you do not have a teaching or practice session over the period of this module, you can still leverage on the discussion of peers to plan an evaluation at the next possible opportunity. For the purpose of the FULT reflective e-portfolio, you can retrospectively revisit a past teaching session.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id=""moving-from-evaluation-to-scholarly-publication"">Moving from evaluation to scholarly publication</h3>
                  
                  <p>Evaluation and research are closely aligned concepts, for example, researchers may have observed that the stages of your mini-evaluation which include the actions of Plan, Act and Reflect align closely with a model of Action Research (Kemmis, McTaggart &amp; Nixon, 2014). An evaluation process is usually specific to a context  (Alkin, 2011), data is delimited and findings are related to quality enhancement. In contrast, research aims to produce findings that may be generalisable to many contexts and may contribute to scholarship through dissemination as publications.</p>
                  
                  <p>The focus of this course is on evaluation as a process for enhancing learning and teaching. Evaluation is essential to any quality process. In this context, if you are using secondary data, it would not usually require human ethics approval.</p>
                  
                  <p>Secondary data includes that generated as a by-product of higher education administration, for example, enrolments, LMS activity logs, CATEI/MyExperience. You must make sure that any evaluation process you do adheres to the relevant university guidelines and policies.  These will have considerable differences in different national and institutional contexts.</p>
                  
                  <p>However, if you are collecting primary evaluation data as part of a research project with the intention of publishing results, then you will need to obtain human ethics approval. Primary data may include assignments, surveys, observations, interviews, focus groups, or informal feedback from students. If you would like to learn more about human ethics you can explore the links provided in the &#8220;want to know more?&#8221; section of this step.</p>
                  
                  <p>We ask you to check the protocols and processes regarding ethics approval in your institution (this is often dictated at a national level).</p>

                  <p>This week provides a scaffold to think about how to move from evaluation to enhancement.</p>
                  
                  <p>Over the past four weeks, we guided you through a journey which focused on evaluation exploring a variety of aspects which included a discussion of methods and approaches and the consideration of a systematic approach to evaluation of specific aspects of practice. We then moved onto a debate about what can be measured in regard to student experience and what Higher Education institution commonly measure (and care about).</p>
                  
                  <p>Now we ask that you take a few steps back, distancing yourself from the evaluation process to look at the &#8216;bigger&#8217; picture. 
                  In particular, this week we focus on:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>key aspects affecting your practice moving from the individual (micro) to the broader context (macro)</li>
                    <li>a range of external factors at different levels affecting practice (at micro level, in the classroom and at the individual level)</li>
                    <li>reflecting on your practice within the broader policy framework</li>
                    <li>positioning your enhancement within the strategic frameworks of your contexts.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>We need to consider the different level of analysis &#8211; so that you can:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>place your practice within the context (i.e. micro, meso and macro)</li>
                    <li>become aware of regulations and policies which may govern your practice and evaluation</li>
                    <li>try to understand the complexities around the concepts of Quality Assurance and Quality Enhancement.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>These may lead to a difficulty in determining metrics and how to demonstrate improvement/enhancement.</p>

"5.2","What is enhancement of learning and teaching","Article","","","Week 5","2017-05-15","15 May","Week 5: The broader context","https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/enhancing-learning-and-teaching/1/steps/187813","[<div class=""a-text-context a-text-context--bold-intro"">
                  <p>The concept of quality is a complex one and can mean different things to different people. For example, students and staff may differ in how they describe what quality learning and teaching means (Houston, 2007). We look at enhancing quality at three levels: micro, meso and macro.</p>
                  
                  <p>Assuring and enhancing the quality of learning and teaching has gained increasing prominence in recent years. Engaging in any quality assurance or enhancement process requires documenting evidence. Monitoring quality requires evidence. 
                  The focus of this course has been on gathering evidence through the processes of evaluation and reflection.</p>
                  
                  <p>&#8220;Governments, students, industry and the broader community now expect universities to provide evidence of the quality of their activities, including teaching and its contribution to successful student outcomes&#8221; (Krause, 2012, p.235).</p>
                  
                  <p>There are two key terms requiring a clear definition:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Quality assurance</strong> - refers to the maintenance and monitoring of standards related to learning and teaching</li>
                    <li><strong>Quality enhancement</strong> - refers to the continuous improvement of learning and teaching, informed by robust evaluation data.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>Most higher education providers will have a quality framework in place which outlines the policy (UNSW, 2016c) and procedures for both assuring and enhancing quality. An academic program review policy will outline how often a program needs to be reviewed, for example at UNSW it is every seven years (UNSW, 2016a). Reviewing courses or subjects, curriculum and even individual classes, tutorials and practicals for quality assurance and enhancement should be undertaken frequently. At a micro level, informal reviews can take place daily when an educator reflects on a class or curriculum design.</p>

                  <p>Meso usually falls between the micro and macro levels. At the university, it typically refers to the Institutional or Faculty/Department/School level usually targeting program/degrees rather than courses.</p>
                  
                  <p>Most higher education providers are committed to continuously improving the quality of learning and teaching. There are procedures and protocols in the governance of the organisation that relate to quality assurance and quality enhancement. These can be explicitly written into policy documents, or be understood in formal or informal guidelines and accepted as standard practice.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>You will be asked to find an example of one these documents when you undertake the exercise activity in this step.</strong></p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Student evaluation surveys</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>At the meso level, institutions often rely on student evaluation surveys as a source of evidence for the quality of teaching. For example, at UNSW we use the CATEI (Course and Teaching Evaluation and Improvement - now called myExperience).</p>
                  
                  <p>While information collected through CATEI/myExperience is considered quite reliable, it does not directly measure the effectiveness of teaching. Survey data should be contextualised, and preferably interpreted together with other sources of data / evidence / feedback to build a comprehensive picture of your teaching.</p>
                  
                  <p>You may wish to refer to the resources on the UNSW Teaching Gateway to help you make sense of your end-of-semester evaluation reports (i.e. <a href=""https://teaching.unsw.edu.au/catei"">https://teaching.unsw.edu.au/catei</a>).</p>

                  <p>National level Standards Agencies have wide responsibilities for regulating national standards and quality, and have often accrediting powers for educational providers and qualifications.
                  These external quality of teaching standards are reflected, to a degree in the professional development frameworks, such as UNSW HR academic promotion toolkit or <a href=""https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/ukpsf"">UKPSF</a> in the UK.</p>
                  
                  <p>Professional accreditation bodies provide frameworks including expectations of what graduates in particular programs/subject areas should be able to display.</p>

                  <p>The outcomes of evaluation carried out at different levels are an essential source of evidence which can be shaped to demonstrate quality, the achievement of appropriate standards, impact and excellence.</p>
