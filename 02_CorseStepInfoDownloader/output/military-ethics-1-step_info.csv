                  <p>While military ethics is pretty unique, it&#8217;s still a part of ethics in general, and to get a good grip on military ethics requires a foundational understanding of the dominant approaches to ethics that apply across the spectrum of ethics.</p>
                  
                  <p>So that&#8217;s the task of this week and next week, to gain an understanding of military ethics&#8217; more general foundations. This week we begin by introducing a key distinction in ethics &#8211; that between ethical dilemmas and tests of integrity. We then go on to explore two of the most influential approaches to addressing ethical dilemmas, consequentialism (focused on utilitarianism) and deontological ethics (focused on Kantian ethics).</p>

                  <p>Dr Stephen Coleman, Ethics, UNSW Canberra</p>
                  
                  <p>Ethics is a branch of philosophy, which examines questions about human conduct, specifically addressing questions of what is right and wrong, just and unjust, virtuous and non-virtuous in such conduct. Thus many questions or claims are, in one way or another, issues of ethics. For example, a person who asserts the claim that &#8220;might makes right&#8221; is making a statement about ethics, as is a person who claims that it is acceptable to lie in certain circumstances, as is a person who suggests that abortion is always wrong.</p>
                  
                  <p>Any decision which involves an ethical component is an ethical decision (i.e. it is a decision about an ethical issue) and that is what I mean when I use the term in the following discussion. It is important to be clear about this point, since this usage of the term doesn&#8217;t necessarily match up to everyday discussions. If, for example, a person says something like &#8220;Bill made a very ethical decision when he reported his supervisor for harassing that new employee&#8221;, then they are clearly using the term &#8216;ethical decision&#8217; as a shorthand for &#8216;ethically correct decision&#8217;. However, there can be good ethical decisions and there can be bad ethical decisions, so in this discussion the term will be used simply to refer to a decision which has an ethical component.</p>
                  
                  <p>Given that an ethical decision is a decision which has an ethical component, and that ethics addresses questions of right and wrong in human behaviour, it should be obvious that ethical decision-making is something which everyone is actually very familiar with, whether they are aware of this or not. A decision to participate in a protest about a newly proposed government policy is an ethical decision, as is a decision to knowingly falsify an income tax return, as is a decision to tell a cashier that they have given you too much change after your purchase, as is a decision to go to war.</p>
                  
                  <p>While ethical decision-making is something which everyone actually engages in, not all ethical decisions are equally important. In the decisions mentioned above, telling the cashier they having given you too much change is obviously a pretty minor decision, while going to war is equally obviously a very serious decision. In the same way that some decisions are more important than others, some ethical decisions are more difficult than others, and it is important to note that there are two, quite distinct, ways in which difficulty might arise. When faced with, or examining, a difficult ethical decision, it is important to understand where the difficulty lies, since recognising this helps to clarify the problems involved in the decision. The first way in which an ethical decision might be difficult is because it is very hard to work out what the right thing to do actually is; this might be because there are a lot of competing considerations, all more or less equally important, or it might be because every option in a particular situation is a bad option. The second way in which an ethical decision might be difficult is because it might be hard, for a range of reasons, to actually do the right thing, and this sort of difficulty can arise even when it is perfectly obvious what the right thing to do actually is. Difficult ethical decisions of the first sort, when it is hard to work out what the right thing to do is, can be referred to as ethical dilemmas (or sometimes, as a test of ethics). Difficult ethical decisions of the second sort, where it is hard to actually do the right thing, can be referred to as tests of integrity.</p>
                  
                  <p>Tests of integrity and ethical dilemmas may be equally difficult to deal with, but the difficulty in each of these situations lies in a different area. In the case of an ethical dilemma, the difficulty is in deciding what the right thing to do is. In the case of a test of integrity, the difficulty lies not in deciding what the right thing to do is, but in actually doing it. Sometimes a particular decision might involve both types of difficulty, so even after resolving the ethical dilemma (i.e. working out what the right thing to do is) a person is still faced with a test of integrity (difficulty in actually doing the right thing). However, most problematic ethical decisions do fit relatively neatly into one of these two categories.</p>
                  
                  <p>It might seem a little odd to suggest that a generally good person might actually have difficulty in doing the right thing, but there are actually a range of reasons why it may be difficult for a person to do what they know to be the right thing in a situation where they are faced with a test of integrity. It may be, for example, that doing the right thing is unpopular, either with that person&#8217;s friends, family or peers, or with the community at large. Or it might be that there is a lot of pressure, in one way or another, placed on that person to not do the right thing, in that they might be bribed, bullied, or blackmailed. The person might have a lot to gain from not doing the right thing, such as significant financial rewards, or the person or those close to them might have a lot to lose from the person doing the right thing in this case. But if a person knows what the right thing to do is, but find it difficult to actually do the right thing, then they are facing a test of integrity, whether the difficulty is caused by pressure, or the chance of gain, or any of the other reasons just mentioned.</p>

"1.9","Reading: Consequentialist ethics","Article","","","Week 1","2016-02-29","29 Feb","Week 1: Foundations - Part 1","https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/military-ethics/1/steps/53226","[<div class=""a-text-context a-text-context--bold-intro"">
                  <p><strong>Dr. Deane-Peter Baker, Ethics, UNSW Canberra</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>For many people today, when faced with an ethical dilemma, their intuitive response will be to weigh the consequences of each possible course of action against one another, and choose the course of action which results in the best overall consequences for all the people affected. Perhaps without realising it, those who make their ethical decisions following this intuition are applying the central tenet of an ethical system called utilitarianism, a form of consequentialism, which was developed in England in the 18th Century. There are other approaches to ethics that focus on consequences, or contain some element of consequentialism, but utilitarianism so dominates this approach to ethics that it is the only theory we will consider here.</p>
                  
                  <p>The early utilitarians, most notably Jeremy Bentham (1748 &#8211; 1842) &#8211; often thought of as the &#8216;father&#8217; of utilitarianism &#8211; and John Stuart Mill (1806-1873), were responding to a social environment in which the rise of secularism and atheism had left something of an intellectual vacuum. If God does not define for us what is right and wrong, they asked themselves, then how shall we know what to do? Influenced also by the rise of modern science, Bentham found what he believed to be the answer in the &#8216;two sovereign masters&#8217; that all of us are subject to, namely pain and pleasure. The utilitarians reasoned that if pain is bad and pleasure is good then the clearest answer to the question &#8216;what should we do&#8217; is to do that which minimises pain and maximises pleasure for the greatest number of those who are affected by our actions. The most well-known statement of utilitarianism is that it defines right actions by what results in &#8216;the greatest happiness for the greatest number&#8217;. Expressed in neutral terms (because, after all, some people prefer to be unhappy!), the idea is to maximise utility (i.e. whatever it is that each individual needs/wants/desires/prefers) for the greatest number.</p>
                  
                  <p>As simple as this all sounds, there are a number of challenging questions within utilitarianism, and as a result there are different kinds of utilitarianism espoused by groups of thinkers who give different answers to those questions. When considering a group of people affected by some possible action, should we be interested in maximising the overall amount of utility in the group (in which case it is not a problem if the act makes some people very happy, and most people not much happier, or even a bit unhappy), or should we be interested in maximising utility for each person affected by the action? Should we weigh all forms of utility equally? (Bentham thought so, but Mill thought we should give more weight to what he called &#8216;higher pleasures&#8217;). Do we have to weigh up all the potential consequences for every decision we make, or are there some rules we can follow that will generally lead to utility maximising outcomes? (Those who think there are such rules are called &#8216;rule utilitarians&#8217;).</p>
                  
                  <p>The two great strengths of utilitarianism are, firstly, that it takes consequences seriously, something that most of us find intuitively appealing; and, secondly, that (Mill aside) it is essentially neutral about what sorts of things matter, or are important &#8211; all that matters is whether or not they have utility for people. So in that respect it seems to maximise freedom of choice and equality of choice &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t matter whether it is listening to opera or collecting toothpicks that gives you utility, it&#8217;s that it gives you utility that matters.</p>
                  
                  <p>That&#8217;s not to say that utilitarianism doesn&#8217;t face some serious challenges. In a way, the strongest objections to utilitarianism are the flip side of its greatest strengths. While most people intuitively agree that consequences matter in ethics, the exclusive focus on overall consequences in utilitarianism and other forms of consequentialism (more about those below) seems to overlook the moral importance of the individual. If, say, the act that will maximise utility for most of the people affected involves harming or disrespecting an individual, there seems to be nothing in utilitarianism that would suggest we should hesitate to endorse that act. Likewise, many have objected that the focus on good consequences can override considerations of justice. The idea that &#8216;the ends justify the means&#8217; is one that sits uncomfortably for many of us. Indeed, this kind of concern led Karl Popper one of the greatest philosophers of the twentieth century, to state that &#8220;it is not only impossible but very dangerous to attempt to maximize the pleasure or the happiness of the people, since such an attempt must lead to totalitarianism&#8221; (Popper 2002, 339). (Popper did not propose abandoning utilitarianism, but instead advocated for what he called &#8216;negative utilitarianism&#8217;, which replaces the goal of maximising pleasure with minimising pain.)</p>
                  
                  <p>The focus on consequences also, in most forms of utilitarianism, largely treats motives as irrelevant &#8211; it&#8217;s outcomes that matter, not intentions. But most of us would agree that it does matter, ethically, what our motives and intentions are in doing what we do. Consequences are, furthermore, often difficult to predict in advance, particularly when self-interest is involved (which is more often than not the case in ethics), which makes basing our ethical decisions entirely on our projections of future outcomes seem somewhat iffy. A related problem is that overall utility is difficult to calculate. Bentham was enthusiastic about the potential of reducing utilitarianism to a kind of scientific calculation, measuring &#8216;utils&#8217; and &#8216;hedons&#8217; in terms of such considerations as intensity, duration, certainty and remoteness. Most other utilitarians, however, have distanced themselves from this sort of thinking, and acknowledge that there&#8217;s an inherent difficulty in trying to weigh up different, and sometimes incommensurable, goods. How, for example, are we to weigh the utility of a chocolate bar against the utility of a beautiful sunset?</p>
                  
                  <p>Another set of challenges that utilitarianism faces centre on the neutrality of utility. As we&#8217;ve seen, even Mill was uncomfortable with this &#8211; do we really want to say that collecting toothpicks is as valuable and meaningful an activity as enjoying a great opera? If (as is undoubtedly the case) more people get more pleasure overall from watching television dramas than those who gain satisfaction from studying ancient manuscripts, are we really going to say that the money that is spent on preserving and protecting ancient manuscripts should be re-allocated to television drama production?</p>
                  
                  <p>Another challenge faced by utilitarianism is that it is extremely demanding. Often people think they are applying utilitarian thinking when they choose actions that lead to the best consequences for themselves and those they care about. But this is not utilitarianism at all, it is a largely discredited form of consequentialism known as &#8216;ethical egoism&#8217; (discredited because it relies on the dubious claim that if we each seek our own happiness and ignore questions about the happiness or well-being of others, things will generally turn out for the best for everyone). The true utilitarian knows that when she weighs up courses of action her own happiness or utility, and that of those she cares about, should weigh no more than the happiness or utility of every other person affected, even complete strangers or enemies.
                  Despite these challenges and its comparatively short history utilitarianism is today arguably the most influential single approach to applied ethics.</p>

"1.11","Reading: Deontological ethics","Article","","","Week 1","2016-02-29","29 Feb","Week 1: Foundations - Part 1","https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/military-ethics/1/steps/53278","[<div class=""a-text-context a-text-context--bold-intro"">
                  <p><strong>Dr Paula Keating, Tutor and Guest Lecturer, UNSW Canberra<strong/></strong></p>
                  
                  <p>The most influential alternative to consequentialist theories of ethics is the deontological approach. The broad field of deontological ethics is made up of numerous ethical frameworks that have in common a foundational structural feature, namely that ethical behaviour is defined in terms of adherence to a set of ethical rules or duties. Examples of deontological ethical frameworks can be found throughout recorded human history &#8211; a well-known example is the Ten Commandments, found in the Hebrew Scriptures, which have a central place in Jewish and Christian ethics. While many deontological codes of ethics are religious in nature, there are also many that are not. Arguably the most influential theory of deontological ethics that is not dependent on a religious metaphysical underpinning is the ethical theory proposed by Immanuel Kant (1724 &#8211; 1804).</p>
                  
                  <p>The problem Kant addresses in his moral philosophy can be summed up by his own question: what should I do? This is, of course, our problem too. The shortest answer we could say Kant gives to this question is, act morally! Before Kant, moral philosophy had many definitions of what it means to act morally. It had already been proposed that acting morally meant following the natural order of things, the social order, the will of God, moral feeling or the desire for happiness. Kant argues that if we follow these paths the demands of ethics or the demand to be good cannot be given objective validity. These previous conceptions of morals always come to be dependent on some condition or experience. For Kant the deontologist, if the command to act morally is to be at all useful it needs to be able to stand as an unconditional and universally reliable principle that is applicable across time and circumstance.</p>
                  
                  <p>In order to find this objectively valid origin for moral philosophy, Kant begins with its subject &#8211; us! In particular, he begins with the phenomenon that we can and do act against what nature sets out before us. We can do things that don&#8217;t make us happy, that we don&#8217;t feel like doing, that aren&#8217;t part of our repertoire of instincts, needs, desires and passions. We humans can choose to act against all of these strong conditions. For Kant, this is a very important point about being human. We have the ability to choose how we act because we have a capacity to will what we do. The will is an aspect of our faculty of reason that Kant called practical reason. Practical reason is the phenomenon that we don&#8217;t just follow the laws of nature but rather can set our own laws, recognise them as principles and then direct our behaviour in accordance with them. Practical reason is nothing other than the will.</p>
                  
                  <p>The will is what, in Kant&#8217;s view, distinguishes humans from animals, who he argues are slaves to their own instincts. As humans, our practical reason (our will) is free from the laws of nature, it is autonomous because through the will we can decide on our own laws to follow. So, for example, even if I am hungry I can still choose to share the food I have with my brother. Kant grounds his practical reason &#8211; or ethics - on the idea of rational freedom, which is of course a much more involved concept for Kant than the one just stated. Nonetheless enough has been said to explain what it means for Kant when he says &#8220;Act!&#8221; It means use your practical reason, be a rational autonomous agent, use your will to write your own laws and follow them.</p>
                  
                  <p>Understanding what &#8220;act&#8221; means for Kant is important because all versions of the categorical imperative, one of the most famous ethical formulations in history, begin with this very word. Kant offered at least three formulations of the categorical imperative &#8211; some scholars would argue that there are five &#8211; but the versions of the categorical imperative that are most commonly employed by applied ethicists are:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>The first formulation</strong>: Act only in accordance with that maxim [or principle] through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law.</p>
                  
                    <p><strong>The second formulation</strong>: Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>The first formulation of the categorical imperative calls us to ensure that our reasons for acting are universal, that they are what everyone else in like circumstances ought to do. In order to be moral, Kant argues, we must put aside all our own wants and preferences, and determine our will as if we were legislating for all other wills in the world. The categorical imperative is the highest standard for all ethical behaviour. So, you ask yourself, am I acting with an intention that I also would want everyone else to have as their reason for acting? The categorical imperative commands us to not think of ourselves as just acting in isolation, but rather shows how our individual moral decisions are of general significance and concern the world at large.</p>
                  
                  <p>The second formulation of the categorical imperative (Kant claimed that all of the different formulations amount to the same thing, though that is somewhat difficult to grasp) emphasises Kant&#8217;s view that what matters most about human beings is that we can freely will (this idea is sometimes captured in the notion that we are agents). If that is what matters most about human beings, then our highest ethical duty to one another is to respect that fact, by not acting in a way that undermines other people&#8217;s ability to exercise their practical reason (will). To treat them in such a way amounts to treating them as a mere means to an end, rather than respecting them as an agent. In our everyday language we capture what is problematic about such behaviour in phrases like &#8216;you shouldn&#8217;t use her that way&#8217; or &#8216;you&#8217;re just using me to get what you want!&#8217; Of course we do often use one another as a means to an end &#8211; if I ask you to make me a cup of coffee, then I am using you as a means to achieve my goal of enjoying a hot brew. But it is important not to overlook the phrase &#8216;mere means&#8217; in Kant&#8217;s second formulation of the categorical imperative. So long as you willingly choose to carry out my request to make me a cup of coffee &#8211; that is, so long as you exercise your will &#8211; then I have not used you as a mere means to my end. To use someone as a mere means to an end means that we somehow bypass or override their ability to act on their free will. So, to continue with the example, if I point a gun at you and demand that you make me a cup of coffee, then I don&#8217;t allow you to choose your course of action. Likewise, if I lie to you in order to get you to make me a cup of coffee (perhaps I say that the coffee is for someone else), then by not giving you the true facts of the situation I have voided your ability to freely choose what you wish to do. I have failed to respect you as a rational being.</p>
                  
                  <p>Systems of deontological ethics face the criticism that they lack flexibility, and seem to ignore consequences despite the fact that consequences clearly seem to matter in ethics. Kant&#8217;s ethics faces this criticism in the form of the &#8216;inquiring murderer&#8217; case. It seems that if someone intent on committing murder were to ask a good Kantian to reveal the location of the murderer&#8217;s intended prey, the Kantian would &#8211; as directed by the categorical imperative &#8211; be required to tell the truth to the murderer. This is clearly problematic! Another criticism of deontological ethics in general is that sometimes circumstances arise in which two or more ethical principles seem to apply, but in a manner that offers conflicting direction about what the right thing to do is. A delightful hypothetical example of this is raised in Colin Radford&#8217;s classic short paper &#8216;The Umpire&#8217;s Dilemma&#8217; (1985).</p>

Next week we continue to lay the foundations of our enquiry into military ethics by examining a third general approach to ethics, one that focuses on character, and then considering a way that I think helps us to get the best out of all three approaches, what I call ethical triangulation.

                  <p>Last week we explored what we might call the &#8216;act-centric&#8217; approaches to ethics: consequentialism and deontological ethics. In both those approaches the emphasis is on evaluating whether particular acts are ethical or not. But there is also an ancient approach to ethics which has a different focus.</p>
                  
                  <p>In virtue ethics, which emerged most notably in ancient Greece, the central focus is on character &#8211; &#8216;what should I do?&#8217; is a secondary question to &#8216;who should I be?&#8217;.</p>

                  <p>Professor Tom Frame, Director of the <a href=""http://www.acsacs.unsw.adfa.edu.au/researchers/military_history/tom_frame.html"">Australian Centre for the Study of Armed Conflict</a>, UNSW Canberra</p>
                  
                  <p>Implicit in the ancient writings of Plato (428/427 or 424/423 &#8211; 348/347 BC) and more particularly Aristotle (384 &#8211; 322 BC), &#8216;Virtue Ethics&#8217; is one of the oldest approaches to normative ethics still studied by modern philosophers. Virtue Ethics is distinguished from other major theories in its emphasis on virtues or moral character ahead of the &#8216;deontological&#8217; approach which highlights duties and rules, and &#8216;consequentialism&#8217; which concentrates on the affects of attitudes and actions. The primary or cardinal virtues canvassed in Plato&#8217;s Republic are prudence, justice, fortitude and temperance. They are a form of knowledge and are necessary for the acquisition of ultimate goodness. In Aristotle&#8217;s Nicomachean Ethics produced in the fourth century BC, the goal of human striving is not power, wealth or prestige but the exercise of rationality in accordance with the virtues so as to produce traits like honesty, friendliness and pride.</p>
                  
                  <p>In focusing on personal traits rather than individual actions, Virtue Ethics transcends the question of whether an action is good or bad. Instead it offers guidance on the whole of a person&#8217;s life, with special interest in the kinds of aptitudes and attributes a good person should seek to acquire and display. Virtue Ethics is not, therefore, primarily interested in what an individual might do but in what they might become, as a means of building a more moral society that essentially encourages virtues more than it discourages vice.</p>
                  
                  <p>Virtue Ethics was the preferred approach in Western moral philosophy until the Enlightenment, influencing both Christian and non-Christian thinkers. It regained Anglo-American prominence with the article &#8216;Modern Moral Philosophy&#8217; by the British analytical philosopher Elisabeth Anscombe (1919 &#8211; 2001) which reflected prevailing dissatisfaction with contemporary deontology and utilitarianism when first published in 1958. Her thinking, particularly in her seminal work Intention, was complemented by the work of Sir Bernard Williams (1929 &#8211; 2003) on truth and truthfulness and the claim by Alasdair MacIntyre in After Virtue? that moral communities are crucial to the formation of virtuous individuals. Each philosopher called for a change of emphasis in moral philosophy from rules and obligations to practices and habits that have the potential to generate virtues and enrich social interactions.</p>
                  
                  <p>There are three main strands of modern Virtue Ethics. The first strand is classical &#8216;Eudaimonism&#8217; which discloses its continuing debt to Greek philosophy in three related concepts: ar&#234;te (the virtues); phronesis (practical wisdom); and eudaimonia (flourishing). The virtues are essentially habits that allow individuals to succeed in their appointed purpose. By practicing the virtues in the course of everyday life a person will achieve eudaimonia &#8211; which can be translated as &#8216;the good life&#8217; or as &#8216;well-being&#8217;. Instead of fixating on whether a particular action is right or wrong, or good or bad, Eudaimonism poses the more expansive question: &#8216;how should I live?&#8217; For Aristotle, the distinctive functioning of human beings is reasoning. Therefore, a good life is a consistently reasoned one.</p>
                  
                  <p>The second strand emphasises the importance of agency and is associated with the contemporary American philosopher Michael Slote who contends that virtues are those characteristics, such as compassion, kindness and generosity, we identify and find admirable in the lives of other people &#8211; our moral exemplars. Evaluating actions depends on the ethical quality of the inner life of those who perform them.</p>
                  
                  <p>The ethics of care, the third strand, has been promoted mainly by feminist philosophers such as the New Zealand-born Annette Baier (1929 &#8211; 2012) who have argued that familiar feminine traits, such as caring and nurturing, which are essential for human wholeness and social happiness have been neglected by men who think of virtues in masculine terms leading them to elevate autonomy and justice to pre-eminence.</p>
                  
                  <p>The three strands of Virtue Ethics are united in their commitment to the following general principles:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>in order to live well a person needs moral characteristics called virtues; </li>
                  <li>a virtuous person is one who acts virtuously at all times; </li>
                  <li>a person acts virtuously if and when they possess and exercise the virtues; </li>
                  <li>an action is only right if it is an action that a virtuous person would carry out in similar circumstances. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Significantly, most virtue theorists insist that for an action to be declared virtuous it must be the outcome of a rational decision and not the product of instinct. Being virtuous requires thought and demands choices.</p>
                  
                  <p>Like any approach, Virtue Ethics has its strengths and weaknesses. It tends to offer generalised advice rather than provide specific counsel. While its emphasis on the totality of the human person works against compartmentalizing the ethical aspects of human interaction from a person&#8217;s economic or political outlook, it does not provide clear guidance, for instance, on resolving moral dilemmas in which the choice is not between good and bad but the lesser of two evils where one is obliged to select from equally unpalatable options. Critics of Virtue Ethics have also questioned the inventory of virtues provided by its proponents, asking why some virtues deserve to be more esteemed than others and arguing that agendas far removed from moral philosophy may be exerting an unexamined influence. For instance, cultural preferences and prejudices may be the basis upon which certain behaviours are subjectively elevated to prominence rather than on their intrinsic value or collective worth. Others think the whole approach unfair as some people will be fortunate and receive sound moral nurture while others will be exposed to appalling examples of immorality through no fault of their own.</p>
                  
                  <p>Although Virtue Ethics has a formidable pedigree claiming many profound thinkers of considerable erudition, it remains the minority approach particularly in the field of applied ethics which has been dominated by the deontological-utilitarian debate. In recent years an increasing number of Virtue Ethicists have written on issues in applied ethics while some have attempted to move from moral philosophy to political philosophy in which Virtue Ethics addresses questions of statecraft and nationhood. The continuing emphasis on the training of character in Virtue Ethics remains its most significant contribution to modern Western life.</p>

"2.5","Reading: Stoicism and the profession of Arms","Article","","","Week 2","2016-03-07","7 Mar","Week 2: Foundations -Part 2","https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/military-ethics/1/steps/53411","[<div class=""a-text-context a-text-context--bold-intro"">
                  <p>Dr Richard Adams, Naval Officer and Adjunct Senior Lecturer, UNSW Canberra</p>
                  
                  <p>Stoicism is a virtue ethic that is well expressed by the adage &#8216;bear and forebear,&#8217; (Epictetus 1998, 10.5-8). Stoicism resonates strongly with the fabled military traits of self-control, discipline and endurance. Thus, while a minority view in contemporary ethics in general, the particular appeal of Stoicism to military personnel makes it a pertinent topic for this course.</p>
                  
                  <p>Stoicism was made famous as a philosophy for the profession of arms by Vice Admiral James Bond Stockdale, USN (1923 &#8211; 2005). A naval aviator, Stockdale was shot down in 1965 and captured by the North Vietnamese. Enduring over seven years in the notorious prison known as the &#8216;Hanoi Hilton&#8217;, Stockdale was in solitary confinement for four years, in leg irons for two years and tortured fifteen times. In 1976 he was awarded the Medal of Honor for indefatigable resistance as a prisoner of war. Famously it was the writings of the Stoic Epictetus, which inspired Stockdale in his gallant defiance.</p>
                  
                  <p>In Epictetus, Stockdale found a hard-edged philosophy which will &#8220;do you good if your child dies, or if your brother dies, or if you must die or be tortured&#8230; (if you must be) enchained, how to be racked, how to be exiled&#8221; (Stockdale 1993, 5). Stockdale described Stoicism as the proper philosophy for the military arts (Stockdale 1995, 21; 1993, 3, 6).</p>
                  
                  <p>A forerunner of Stoic thought was Socrates, who epitomised Stoic indifference to physical comfort and showed himself to be devoid of pretence. When unjustly put on trial for his life, Socrates&#8217; &#8220;refusal to escape, his calmness in the face of death, and his conviction that the perpetrator of injustice injures himself more than his victim, all fitted in perfectly with stoic teaching,&#8221; (Russell 1995, 261) according to which the tribulations of everyday life are held to have no real power to affect human attitudes. Stoicism also strongly reflects Socrates&#8217; view that it is only the good will that truly matters.</p>
                  
                  <p>From the philosophy known as Cynicism came the idea that the &#8220;nature or physis of a man consists in his rationality&#8221; (Long 1974, 110). Investing this principle with particular stringency, the Cynics argued that people need nothing apart from physical and mental self-discipline. Thus, the so-called &#8216;externals&#8217; &#8211; things conventionally regarded as good such as property and reputation &#8211; are irrelevant to human flourishing. Likewise focused on self-mastery, the Stoic dismisses possessions, offices and honours as things that delude us and draw us away from what truly matters, prohairesis &#8211; which we might understand as moral character, integrity, will or self. Likewise, the Stoic sees fear, concern and anxieties as insubstantial pretenders which, properly understood, are insufficient to impede us in fulfilling our moral duty. For the Stoic, self-respect &#8211; aidos &#8211; is a decisive moral quality. Thus, the philosophy belittles physical harm, since physical harm is nothing in comparison to the devastating agony of shame should a person fall down in a duty.</p>
                  
                  <p>As Stockdale&#8217;s example shows, Stoicism is a potentially powerful worldview for military personnel. Nonetheless, as a general philosophy of life Stoicism faces the criticism that it undermines our humanity, particularly in assigning the relationships that most of us take as central to human flourishing &#8211; including those with our families, friends and colleagues &#8211; to the pile of &#8216;externals&#8217; to which we are expected to be indifferent. For military personnel there are two further particular points of concern. The first is the possibility that Stoic idealism contributes to post-traumatic stress. The second is the possibility that Stoic soldiers, fulfilling their duty as they see it, become implicated in crimes of obedience.</p>
                  
                  <p>Resilient and dependable, the Stoic is a soldier of substance and obligation. But the sense of commitment and duty, characteristic of the philosophy, sows the seed of vulnerability. This is because Stoicism is not a defence against the betrayal of &#8216;what&#8217;s right&#8217; by the institutions &#8211; political and military &#8211; in which soldiers trust. Furthermore, conditioned as they are to obey without question, and resolved to do their duty without flinching, Stoic soldiers may commit what has been called &#8216;crimes of obedience&#8217; &#8211; those atrocities which occur when authorities give orders that exceed the bounds of morality or law. The moral injury or damage which follows from the betrayal of &#8216;what&#8217;s right&#8217; is recognised by Jonathan Shay, in his book, Achilles in Vietnam (1995). Shay acknowledges the post-traumatic stress, which follows inexorably from terror, shock and grief at the death of friends. But veterans, he argues may be expected to recover from horror, fear and grief. Far less certain is recovery from the moral injury which follows from violation of the soldier&#8217;s sense of rightness.</p>
                  
                  <p>Accordingly, the obligations of Stoicism may be seen as extending beyond the obligations of the individual soldier. Stoicism imposes obligations on the military institution to safeguard the mental wellbeing of the soldiers who serve. Expecting soldiers to bear the burden of their duty stoically, the military leadership bears a reciprocal onus to preserve a sense of &#8220;what&#8217;s right,&#8221; to preserve the moral value of words and to respect moral ideals as being of more than propaganda value.</p>

"2.8","Reading: Ethical Triangulation","Article","","","Week 2","2016-03-07","7 Mar","Week 2: Foundations -Part 2","https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/military-ethics/1/steps/53412","[<div class=""a-text-context a-text-context--bold-intro"">
                  <p>Dr Deane-Peter Baker, Ethics, UNSW Canberra</p>
                  
                  <p>As we have seen, there are essentially three distinct fundamental approaches to ethics. One approach focuses on ensuring good consequences (consequentialism), another focuses on following ethical rules or principles that are mostly intended to ensure respect for others (deontology), and the third approach takes good character, or virtue, as the central feature of the ethical life (virtue ethics). For most of us, each of these approaches resonates deeply. The idea that consequences matter in ethics has strong intuitive appeal, as does the notion that others are deserving of our respect and should not be treated merely as a means to an end. Likewise, there are few of us who don&#8217;t feel the pull of character-based concepts like courage, integrity, compassion and honour.</p>
                  
                  <p>We have also seen, however, that each of these approaches faces challenges. Utilitarianism, the dominant form of consequentialism, seems to have trouble accounting for the importance of the individual, and sometimes seems to give rise to counterintuitive results. Likewise, deontological theories of ethics, such as that developed by Immanuel Kant, can sometimes seem too rigid and blind to the importance of consequences in certain circumstances. Stoicism (a virtue theory) represents an enormously powerful way to face conditions of hardship, but that seems to come at the cost of some aspects of our humanity. More generally, virtue approaches to ethics, with their focus on what we should <em>be</em>, don&#8217;t seem to offer us enough clear guidance about what we should <em>do</em> when dealing with moral dilemmas. (This is by no means a comprehensive account of the challenges faced by each of these approaches to ethics; please see the previous chapters for more detail).</p>
                  
                  <p>That leaves us with a problem to solve. If we&#8217;re really interested in taking on ethical challenges with more than just our gut reactions, and we see both the pros and cons of these three broad approaches to ethics, then how should we proceed? One answer is to choose the approach to ethics that seems most correct and dig deeper into the literature to find ways in which that approach can be refined in order to minimise or negate the challenges we have discussed, as well as others we haven&#8217;t mentioned. If you do that you will find that there is a deep and immensely rich tradition of thought associated with each of these three approaches that has been built up over time by some of the finest philosophical minds our world has ever seen. (The &#8216;References and Recommended Reading&#8217; sections of the preceding [readings] will give you a good starting point if you want to start digging). We might call this the <em>philosophical approach</em>.</p>
                  
                  <p>The other approach to this problem is what we might call the <em>pragmatic approach</em>. Here, rather than try to resolve the philosophical difficulties inherent in any of these broad approaches to ethics, we instead apply a practical methodology that seeks to (as far as is possible) get the best out of all three approached while avoiding their worst pitfalls. This is, in practice, what many well trained applied ethicists do &#8211; apply each of the different approaches and concepts as they best fit the circumstances concerned.</p>
                  
                  <p>What makes this <em>pragmatic approach</em> work for professional ethicists is their deep and intuitive understanding of the theory. For most non-specialists, however, there is value in having an explicit methodology to guide us. This chapter outlines one such approach, one I have developed over years of teaching ethics to military officers in training, first at the United States Naval Academy and now at the Australian Defence Force Academy.</p>
                  
                  <p>I call this approach Ethical Triangulation. The idea of &#8216;triangulation&#8217; resonates with military personnel because of the importance of navigation in the military, and the idea fits well with the tripartite nature of mainstream ethical theory. In its simplest form the idea is to, as it were, &#8216;take a bearing&#8217; from each of the main approaches to ethics when considering an ethically challenging question. This ensures that we don&#8217;t overlook any important ethical considerations that might be obscured by applying only one ethical approach, and also benefits from the fact that the strengths of each of these approaches often fall in exactly the ethical &#8216;space&#8217; that the weaknesses of one or both of the other approaches are.</p>
                  
                  <p>As an explicit methodology Ethical Trangulation works like this. The first step is to take a bearing from the ethical peak of &#8216;Respect&#8217; (deontology), by asking ourselves what ethical principles or rules apply to the situation we are considering. For some this is a little counterintuitive as, in my experience, many of us want to begin by examining potential consequences. But there are good reasons for starting with deontology rather than consequentialism. For one thing, deontological theories of ethics represent what we might think of as the collected ethical wisdom of the ages, and the principles embedded in deontological ethics are often (as rule utilitarians recognize) a good guide to achieving the best consequences. Add that to one of the key limitations of consequentialism &#8211; that we&#8217;re often poor at predicting consequences, particularly when self-interest is involved &#8211; and you have good reason to start with deontology.</p>
                  
                  <p>Once we have identified the deontological principles that apply to the case in question, we will either have a first suggestion of what the ethically appropriate action or actions should be, or else we will find that there are competing principles that suggest different courses of action. The next step is to look to the horizon again and consider the possible consequences of the course or courses of action that we are weighing up. In so doing, we might find that the potential consequences of the course of action suggested by our assessment of the deontological principles are serious enough, and certain enough, that those consequences outweigh the deontological principles. This will then point us to a different ethical solution. Alternatively we might find that weighing up the consequences favours one course of action over the alternatives in those cases where conflicting deontological principles suggest different ways forward.</p>
                  
                  <p>The third step is to take a final bearing from the ethical peak of &#8216;Character&#8217; (virtue ethics). This step shifts our attention, for a moment, away from the issue under consideration onto ourselves and what we know about ourselves. This will, of course, be meaningless if we do not know our character well, and here it is worth reminding ourselves of one of the most famous quotes in all of philosophy, alleged to have been uttered by Socrates, that &#8216;the unexamined life is not worth living&#8217; (Plato 1966, 38a). In this step we ask ourselves whether the course of action that our reflection thus far has led us to favour is what a virtuous person would do (an act that is courageous, compassionate, impartial, honourable, and so on), or whether our thinking has been influenced by some or other character flaws (vices) that we know ourselves to possess, such a laziness, selfishness or rashness. Just as a strong magnet can throw off the needle of a compass, our vices can, if we are not careful, affect our ethical decision-making and point us in the wrong ethical direction.</p>
                  
                  <p>Deliberately working through these three steps of Ethical Triangulation should help us, in general, to make better ethical judgements than we would otherwise, and in many cases &#8211; perhaps even most &#8211;that will be all that is needed. Ethics is not, however, a perfect science, and while this process will certainly help us to exclude a significant number of possible courses of action as clearly inappropriate, it is possible that sometimes there will still be an unresolved conflict between two or more possible options that could perhaps be the right thing to do. Here we reach again for the resources of virtue theory, in particular the notion of <em>phronesis</em> or practical wisdom. In this grey area in which theory-driven analysis is sometimes inadequate to the task of giving us final guidance, it becomes a matter of wisdom of how to proceed. Practical wisdom is the ability to appropriately marry up right intentions and good character with practical action. It is the product of experience and the practice of virtuous living, and we will often do well in such cases to seek out guidance from those wiser than ourselves. Some will find this lack of analytic precision in such cases to be frustrating, but we would do well to remember the wisdom of Aristotle himself, who reminds us that &#8216;It is the mark of an educated man to look for precision in each class of things just so far as the nature of the subject admits; it is evidently equally foolish to accept probable reasoning from a mathematician and to demand from a rhetorician scientific proofs.&#8217; (Aristotle 1984, Book I, 1094.b24)</p>

                  <p>Rev. Nikki Coleman, Tutor and PhD candidate, UNSW Canberra</p>
                  
                  <p>Society routinely expects different standards of behaviour depending on what role a person has in society. For example, we expect a minister of religion to not be night clubbing and picking up casual sexual partners, even though it is perfectly legal to do so. We also expect that our elected officials will have a higher standard of behaviour than, say, a used car salesperson, and when our elected officials routinely do not meet these standards it often loses them votes, because their constituents no longer see them as fit for office. Much the same goes for military personnel &#8211; society generally expect a higher standard of behaviour from them than is expected of the average citizen.</p>
                  
                  <p>Stephen Coleman (2013, 38-39) argues that the role morality of the soldier flows from the oath that they take on joining the military; that is, that the soldier promises to serve the state and so is bound by what the state orders them to do. Military values and military virtues will further influence the role morality of the soldier, as will concepts such as Just War Theory, and in particular the principles of discrimination and proportionality in <em>jus in bello</em> [we&#8217;ll meet these concepts later in the course].</p>
                  
                  <p>If an ordinary citizen were to mete out death and destruction in the same way that a soldier does on the battlefield, he or she would be charged with assault or murder. A soldier does not kill in his or her own name, but rather does so in the name of their state, and so is legally and morally absolved from killing others so long as those deaths occur within the bounds of the principles of <em>jus in bello</em> and the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC). This absolution for what would normally be seen as murder is as a result of the role of the soldier, and is a part of their role morality.</p>
                  
                  <p>Military members are routinely asked to perform tasks and respond to things that ordinary members of the civilian population are not expected to do. Soldiers are, by definition, asked to kill others, and put themselves at risk of being killed. They are also exposed to significant risk of physical and mental impairment, and have many of their rights taken away from them, simply because they must obey all legal orders. They are routinely unable to refuse medical treatment, and have their normal rights restricted in a range of other ways. In Australia, for example, military personnel are unable to freely speak to the media, join a union, or complain about their working conditions on social media. In the USA they are not able to sue for negligence, and are at times forced to take part in medical experimentation without their consent. One significant argument given in defence of military personnel being required to give up these rights is a utilitarian one; that soldiers sacrifice these rights (and potentially sacrifice their own lives) so that ordinary citizens may freely exercise the same rights.</p>
                  
                  <p>Another line of argument that is offered as a justification for this situation is a contractual one. According to some theorists, military personnel must obey all legal orders &#8211; including those that would under normal circumstances be considered to be in violation of the rights of those following orders - is that they have distinguished themselves from the rest of society by &#8216;signing up&#8217; to serve their country, and thus by enlisting have agreed to the what is sometimes called the &#8216;unlimited liability contract&#8217; (ULC). This is an implied contract, rather than an explicit legal agreement that military members enter into.</p>
                  
                  <p>Although the (Australian-born) British General Sir John Hackett (1910 &#8211; 1997) was the first to use the term &#8216;unlimited liability contract&#8217;, he did not define it, seemingly assuming that his audience fully understood the concept without his expanding on it. The main point that Hackett made about the ULC, is that it &#8220;sets the military apart from most other groups&#8221; (Hackett 1983, 73). A number of other writers have written briefly on the topic, most notably the distinguished Just War Theorist Michael Walzer (1977, 361) who wrote of the loss of freedom and responsibility which comes with enlistment in the military. Walzer asserted that when citizens become soldiers they forfeit certain human rights, particularly the right to life, in exchange for &#8216;soldier&#8217;s rights&#8217;; that is, that they are immune from prosecution for killing enemy combatants on the battlefield.  Warrior-scholar James Dubik (Lieutenant General, US Army (ret.)) counters that the right to life is an inherent &#8220;natural&#8221; right that cannot be lost or exchanged, as it is not a right that &#8220;goes with the job&#8221; (Dubick 1982, 361-362).</p>
                  
                  <p>Dubik argues that military personnel retain their &#8220;natural&#8221; right to life, and that the government retains its responsibility to ensure that this (and other) rights are protected. Dubik (1982, 363-364) asserts, in contrast to Walzer, that soldiers do not lose or exchange their natural right to life, but rather that soldiers have an increased obligation to protect their fellow citizens, which in turn places soldiers at an increased risk of injury and death. According to Dubik soldiers may be put into morally exceptional circumstances, not because they have relinquished their rights by enlisting, as Walzer maintains, but because they have taken on certain extra moral obligations that ordinary citizens are not bound by. Dubik also argues that officers incur an additional responsibility: &#8220;in addition to being responsible for the control of the means of death and destruction &#8230; are directly responsible to the state, and to the soldier to protect the soldier&#8217;s right to life&#8221; (Dubik 1982, 366).</p>
                  
                  <p>More recently Martin Cook has briefly discussed the idea that there is an implicit commitment between a Military Officer and their government, such that the members of the military shall serve on terms of unlimited liability and shall &#8220;follow lawful orders in full recognition that they may die or be severely injured in fulfilment of those orders&#8221; (Cook 2004, 74). Cook argues that this commitment is &#8220;justified in the mind of the officer because of their moral commitment to the welfare&#8221; of their state (Cook 2004, 74). However Cook&#8217;s main argument in relation to the concept of unlimited liability, drawing on the work of Hackett is that it is what separates the military from ordinary citizens, in that it is what makes the military as a profession <em>sui generis</em> (i.e. unique). This idea that the military is something radically different from a civilian profession, and therefore morally <em>sui generis</em> has been challenged by some sociologists such as Morris Janowitz (1960), who argues that the modern military resembles an ordinary occupation, governed by market principles, and is no longer seen as a life of service. If military service has become something akin to an ordinary career, it seems difficult to sustain the argument that it is morally <em>sui generis</em> &#8211; that the moral norms and principles that apply to ordinary civilians cannot be coherently applied to the military. However, this view of the unlimited liability commitment as being &#8220;the distinctive feature of the military profession <em>vis-&#224;-vis</em> other professions&#8221; remains influential.</p>

"3.6","Reading: Illegal orders and whistleblowing","Article","","","Week 3","2016-03-14","14 Mar","Week 3: Ethics within the military profession","https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/military-ethics/1/steps/56934","[<div class=""a-text-context a-text-context--bold-intro"">
                  <p>Deane-Peter Baker</p>
                  
                  <p>In late 1945 and early 1946 an International Military Tribunal took place in Nuremberg, Germany. It was the most famous of the so-called &#8216;Nuremberg Trials,&#8217; which held senior members of the Nazi regime accountable for their actions during and prior to World War II. This military tribunal famously ended any doubt on a very important issue related to the conduct of military personnel - never again can any well-informed soldier, sailor, airman or marine seriously claim that they are innocent of wrongdoing because they were &#8216;just following orders&#8217;.</p>
                  
                  <p>It is certainly true that military personnel have a legal responsibility to follow orders from those in authority over them; however this responsibility is only attached to legal orders. The reverse is true when it comes to illegal orders &#8211; military personnel have a firm moral responsibility to <em>not</em> carry out illegal orders. Of course most military personnel are not lawyers or experts in the law, so on some occasions it may be difficult to ascertain whether an order is legal or not. Where circumstances allow, such legally ambiguous orders should be resisted until legal clarity is attained. In many cases, however, illegal orders are clearly so. As a general rule of thumb, if an order breaks a fundamental principle of morality, such as the prohibition against inflicting harm on the innocent, there&#8217;s a good chance that it is also illegal.</p>
                  
                  <p>What, practically speaking, should someone in the military do if they are given an illegal order? What is appropriate is a matter of wisdom and is largely dictated by the circumstances. In some cases it might be possible to simply ignore the order. However, while this allows the person receiving the order to keep his or her hands clean, it leaves open the possibility that the person or persons giving the illegal orders will order other subordinates to do illegal acts which might then be carried out. In most cases, therefore, it will be necessary to not only refuse to carry out the order in question, but also to take positive steps to ensure that the person or persons giving the illegal orders are held accountable.</p>
                  
                  <p>In most cases this will involve reporting the illegal order through the appropriate military channels. In some rare cases, however, where that is not possible or proves ineffective, it might be necessary to resort to circumventing the military chain of command and going directly to someone like a responsible government official or even to the media. For example, the massacre that was carried out by US troops (many of whom claimed they were &#8216;just following orders&#8217;) at My Lai in Vietnam in 1968 was reported up the chain of command by Warrant Officer Hugh Thompson (a helicopter pilot who both observed the massacre and, with his crew, intervened to stop some of the killing), but the report was ignored by Thompson&#8217;s superiors. The massacre was only finally investigated after another soldier, Specialist Ronald L. Ridenhour wrote a letter to 30 members of the US Congress. Even then the massacre might not have come to light &#8211; all but three of the Congressmen that Ridenhour wrote to ignored his letter.</p>
                  
                  <p>Ridenhour is an example of what is commonly referred to as a &#8216;whistleblower&#8217;. In a widely quoted definition Janet Near and Marcia Miceli explain that whistle-blowing is &#8220;the disclosure by organization members (former or current) of illegal, immoral, or illegitimate practices under the control of their employers, to persons or organizations that may be able to effect action.&#8221; (Near and Miceli 1985, 4) While the practice of whistle-blowing has become more socially accepted in recent years, there are many who still consider the practice to be morally reprehensible. People who hold this view often consider whistle-blowers to be disloyal, destructive and self-promoting.</p>
                  
                  <p>What should we make of this view? It is certainly true that whistle-blowers can cause significant damage by their actions. For example Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who leaked tens or hundreds of thousands of classified documents to the media undoubtedly damaged US interests, undermined aspects of US national security, and may also have put lives at risk. This risk of damage means that potential whistle-blowers should weigh up whether or not the potential damage caused by their revelations outweighs the good gained from them, and should furthermore be certain that public disclosure is the last reasonable resort available to them. The question of motive is important here. If one is motivated to blow the whistle under some self-serving rationale, such as a desire for public attention or a desire to gain revenge, there is a far greater chance that the requirements of proportionality and last resort will not be met.</p>
                  
                  <p>What of the claim that whistle-blowers are disloyal? Snowden, for example, has been called a traitor, which is at heart a claim that he has betrayed an important trust, that he has been disloyal. Whether or not that is an appropriate characterization of Snowden&#8217;s actions, it is certainly true that some who blow the whistle are disloyal, particularly if in so doing they are acting on inappropriate motives and fail to consider proportionality and last resort. However, when whistle-blowers are motivated by a desire to see justice done and carry out their actions appropriately, the charge of disloyalty is misplaced. In the military context loyalty is usually a fiercely defended value, which has led to some advocating the principle &#8216;loyalty above all else, except justice&#8217;.</p>
                  
                  <p>The problem with this principle is that it seems to accept that the whistle-blower who is acting in the cause of justice must at the same time accept that he or she is being disloyal. But this is mistaken because it mistakes the appropriate locus of loyalty. As Vandekerckhove and Commers write, &#8220;the object of loyalty is not the physicality of an organization,&#8221; or, we might add, the people who make up that organization, &#8220;but its corpus of explicit mission statement, goals, value statement and code of conduct&#8221; (Vandekerckhoven and Commers 2004, 225). In the case of the military, the appropriate object of loyalty is to those principles and values that justify the military&#8217;s existence and actions, as discussed elsewhere in this book.</p>
                  
                  <p>If a whistle-blower acts appropriately to expose a corruption of those principles within a military organization, then he or she is behaving in a way that is more loyal than those who are responsible for that corruption. Whistle-blowers are often isolated and shunned, and their actions can often come at a very significant personal cost. Except where it is the product of inappropriate motivation, or where it is carried out rashly, whistle-blowing is an honourable act that requires considerable moral courage on the part of the whistle-blower.</p>

                  <p><strong>Dr Deane-Peter Baker, Ethics, UNSW Canberra<strong/></strong></p>
                  
                  <p>There are few responsibilities as weighty as those that rest on the shoulders of today&#8217;s military leaders. For one thing, the forces they command have a capacity for destruction that is arguably unprecedented in history. The potential killing power inherent in the highly efficient weapons systems that today&#8217;s military forces can bring to bear brings with it the responsibility of ensuring that those weapons are used in a way that risks as little harm as possible to noncombatants and non-military infrastructure. At the same time, for all the advances that have been made in stand-off weaponry and precision targeting, we have yet to reach the point (and may never reach it) where it is no longer necessary to put &#8216;boots on the ground&#8217; in order to achieve mission success. So there is another responsibility here that military leaders must balance against the first one, the responsibility to protect the lives of the soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines that they lead. And both of these responsibilities must again be balanced against the responsibility to complete the mission at hand. As former US Navy SEAL Dick Couch puts it, &#8216;There are three considerations that are never far from the mind of a commander in an active theater who has squads and platoons in the field:</p>
                  <ol>
                  <li>The value of the target &#8211; collectively, the mission</li>
                  <li> The risk to his own troops</li>
                  <li>The risk to noncombatant civilians</li>
                  </ol>
                  
                  <p>A lot of time and attention, and no small amount of lost sleep, go into balancing these issues, both the tactical considerations as well as moral considerations.&#8221; (Couch 2010, xvii)</p>
                  
                  <p>These three competing responsibilities of mission, own troops and noncombatants are sometimes referred to collectively as <em>the triangular balance</em>. (This should not be confused with the method of ethical triangulation discussed earlier in the course). The great challenge lies in the fact that in practice these responsibilities are interconnected, and pull against one another. If, say, a commander puts a premium on protecting his own troops, then either the mission will suffer - as has allegedly happened in some UN peacekeeping operations in which troop contingent commanders have effectively kept their troops in relatively safe base areas rather than going out on patrol (see, e.g. Howden 2011) - or else noncombatants will suffer as risky patrols are replaced by the use of &#8216;reconnaissance by fire&#8217; and similar methods. If, on the other hand, a commander puts achieving the mission above all else, this could have the effect of putting his or her troops and noncombatants at great risk. Finally, if the decision is made to bring the risk of harm to noncombatants to as close to zero as possible, this may either mean that the mission cannot be carried out at all, or only at the expense of imposing very significant risks onto those who must execute the mission orders.</p>
                  
                  <p>Ultimately, then, it is up to the commander on the spot to work out the appropriate balance between these three competing priorities. There is no hard and fast rule to apply here, and it is, in the end, a matter of wisdom. That said, an important factor that must be taken into consideration is the nature of the overall mission. If, for example, the mission is a humanitarian intervention aimed at preventing the mass killing of noncombatants, it is clearly counterproductive and inappropriate for the intervening force to shift the majority of the risk entailed in the intervention onto the civilian population that they have ostensibly come to rescue. In a war for national survival, on the other hand, it might well be acceptable (albeit painfully regrettable) to push more of the risk onto noncombatants in order to ensure that the mission can be accomplished.</p>
                  
                  <p>What the above examples illustrate is that there are circumstances that bring two of these three competing priorities into closer alignment than would otherwise be the case. In a desperate war of national survival where the results of mission failure could be catastrophic, protecting the force becomes an essential feature of mission success. By contrast, in a counterinsurgency war, where the support of the local population is vital to mission success it is the counterinsurgency forces that must accept the greater risk.</p>
                  
                  <p>Broadly speaking one way of understanding the triangular balance is that it is a summary of what the proportionality requirement of the <em>jus in bello</em> [we&#8217;ll get to this later in the course] looks like from the perspective of the individual commander. It is without question one of the most challenging ethical aspects of the employment of military force, and a key reason why military personnel cannot simply be capable &#8216;technicians of violence&#8217; but must also be deeply ethically aware.</p>
                  
                  <p><em>Note: For a sophisticated attempt at articulating a way to calculate the appropriate weighting of the triangular balance, see David Luban&#8217;s paper <a href=""http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1653&amp;context=facpub"">Risk Taking and Force Protection</a></em></p>

                  <p><strong><a href=""https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/school-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/dr-ned-dobos"">Ned Dobos</a><strong/></strong></p>
                  
                  <p>Pacifism in its most recognisable form is an absolute, principled condemnation of violence. From Jesus&#8217; entreaty to &#8216;turn the other cheek&#8217;, Christian pacifists infer that inflicting physical harm on others &#8211; even in self-defence &#8211; is contrary to the teachings of their faith and therefore forbidden. Mohandas Gandhi (1869 &#8211; 1948) treated <em>ahimsa</em> or non-violence as part of a larger project of spiritual self-transformation. In a similar vein, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (1929 &#8211; 1968) saw merit in being victimised without retaliating: &#8216;unearned suffering is redemptive&#8217;, he was once quoted saying. A more moderate form of pacifism objects not to violence <em>per se</em>, but specifically to the organised, politically-driven, large-scale killing and maiming that characterises warfare. Hence Jenny Teichman refers to this variety of pacifism as &#8216;anti-war-ism&#8217;.</p>
                  
                  <p>The distinctive feature of these &#8216;absolute&#8217; forms of pacifism is that they reject the idea&#8212;taken for granted by Just War Theorists&#8212;that waging war is sometimes morally acceptable as the lesser of two evils. The absolute pacifist denies that Just War Theory accurately captures the demands of morality insofar as it licences mass killing under <em>any</em> conceivable circumstances.</p>
                  
                  <p>Not surprisingly, this position has failed to gain much traction with philosophers of war and military ethicists, for whom Just War Theory remains the most intuitively plausible and theoretically coherent framework for evaluating armed conflict. In recent years, however, a new kind of pacifism has begun to emerge: one which, rather than contesting Just War Theory, embraces it. According to so-called &#8216;contingent&#8217; pacifism, war is indeed morally acceptable if it satisfies the requirements of Just War Theory (just cause; proportionality; last resort etc.) However, no actual war meets these requirements; they are simply not achievable given certain empirical realities. Therefore, while war can in <em>theory</em> be justified, <em>as a matter of fact</em> it never is. On this view, Just War Theory&#8212;when properly interpreted and applied&#8212;leads to a pacifist conclusion.</p>
                  
                  <p>There are a number of different paths to contingent pacifism. Indeed, for each of the familiar principles of Just War Theory, there is a powerful argument that, given the kinds of wars that are fought nowadays and the kinds of people that fight them, that principle is never satisfied in the &#8216;real world&#8217;.</p>
                  
                  <p>Some scholars think that the kinds of wars fought nowadays simply do not satisfy the &#8216;just cause&#8217; requirement. David Rodin (2002), for instance, argues that while it may be permissible to wage war in order to repel an invader that is intent on exterminating us, most wars of national self-defence are not waged to resist this kind of genocidal aggression. Rather, they are waged to protect our political interests, such as our sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as our economic welfare. Are these interests important enough to justify killing the people who threaten them? Rodin insists that they are not. Hence wars of national self-defence are typically not justified: an attack on our political and economic interests is not a &#8216;just cause&#8217;.</p>
                  
                  <p>Other contingent pacifists maintain that modern war is never justified because it never satisfies the Just War principle of &#8216;right intention&#8217;. According to this principle, if a war is being driven by ulterior motives&#8212;such as economic and political advantage, revenge, ethnic hatred, and so on&#8212;that war is unjustified even if a just cause happens to be objectively present (for in this case the just cause functions as a mere pretence). A number of recent publications suggest, in effect, that right intention is always absent these days, given the prevailing structures of political power and the kinds of people that invariably win office. Andrew Fiala&#8217;s <em>The Just War Myth</em>  (2007) and David Keen&#8217;s <em>Useful Enemies: When Waging Wars is More Important than Winning Them</em> (2012), are two noteworthy examples here. The former emphasises the political incentives for war, while the latter suggests that war is and always has been a racket waged for its profitability above all else.</p>
                  
                  <p>Perhaps the most common form of contingent pacifism rests on the observation that, given that wars are increasingly being fought in built-up urban areas with mechanised weapons and aerial bombardment, it is inevitable that some innocent civilians will be harmed. Classical Just War Theory does make allowances for civilian casualties as long they are merely a foreseen side effect of an attack on a legitimate military target, rather than intended as a means or as an end. Here we have the so-called &#8216;doctrine of double effect&#8217; [we&#8217;ll explore this in detail later in the course]. This doctrine has been subject to much critical pressure, however. The distinction between intention and foresight upon which it relies has been dismissed by many thinkers as morally irrelevant. If I speed down the road knowing for certain, but not intending, that I will strike and kill a pedestrian at the crossing, is this really any different, morally speaking, from deliberately running down the pedestrian? If the doctrine of double effect is implausible, then killing civilians with &#8216;mere foresight&#8217; is no better than intentionally killing them. And if intentionally killing civilians is absolutely forbidden, then so too is killing them incidentally (as &#8216;collateral damage&#8217;). And if all modern war can be expected to produce collateral damage, then all modern war is forbidden. Once again, pacifism is the conclusion.</p>
                  
                  <p>Both absolute pacifism and contingent pacifism object to the waging of war. A third kind of pacifism&#8212;so-called <em>institutional</em> pacifism&#8212;has a different focus. The institutional pacifist objects not so much to waging wars with the military resources that we have amassed; he objects to the amassing of those resources to begin with. To put it another way, while absolute and contingent pacifists object to military <em>operations</em>, institutional pacifists object to the very existence of the military. Interestingly, some proponents of this view are willing to accept that individual acts of war might be permissible; they simply deny that this is sufficient to justify the state in creating and maintaining a war-making machine, especially since there are (they believe) alternative arrangements for national defence that are equally effective and less costly in both human and material terms. There is an important insight here: the moral status of any given war, and the moral status of the structures that make it possible, though related, are independent matters.</p>

"4.6","Reading: Realism","Article","","","Week 4","2016-03-21","21 Mar","Week 4: Going to war","https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/military-ethics/1/steps/57313","[<div class=""a-text-context a-text-context--bold-intro"">
                  <p><strong><a href=""https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/school-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/dr-ned-dobos"">Dr Ned Dobos</a>, Ethics, UNSW Canberra<strong/></strong></p>
                  
                  <p>There are two varieties of political realism: descriptive (or factual), and prescriptive (or normative). According to descriptive realism, states are, <em>as a matter of fact</em>, motivated exclusively by national self-interest. Their behaviour is not influenced by moral considerations. On this view, any appeal to ideology and values in world politics is mere rhetoric, concealing the pursuit of power which is at the root of every decision taken in the international arena. Some see this as an inevitable consequence of human nature. Since humans are naturally self-seeking, the argument goes, it is to be expected that this will be reflected in their political institutions. For &#8216;structural&#8217; realists, by contrast, it is the anarchical nature of the international system &#8211; the absence of an &#8216;overarching sovereign&#8217; or &#8216;world government&#8217; &#8211; that explains why states are so preoccupied with their own interests. The absence of a world government makes for an insecure environment which forces states to seek power in order to ensure their own survival.</p>
                  
                  <p>Prescriptive (or normative) realism, on the other hand, says that even if states <em>do</em> behave morally sometimes, they <em>shouldn&#8217;t</em>. States <em>ought</em> to make decisions based exclusively on the national interest. Moral considerations &#8211; of right and wrong, justice and injustice, fairness and unfairness, decency and indecency &#8211; have no place in political decision-making at the international level. Interestingly enough, prescriptive realists often defend their position on distinctly moral grounds. Some suggest that an &#8216;ethical&#8217; foreign policy is fraught with danger and is likely to produce pernicious consequences. They say that the surest route to universal peace and happiness is in fact universal national egoism, where all states concentrate exclusively on their own wealth and power. At work here is an &#8216;indirect utilitarian&#8217; logic: consciously striving for good outcomes produces bad outcomes. Good outcomes are more effectively promoted when everybody acts selfishly. George Kennan (1904 &#8211; 2005), for instance, wrote:</p>
                  
                  <p><em>It is a curious thing &#8230; that the legalistic approach to world affairs, rooted as it unquestionably is in a desire to do away with war and violence, makes violence more enduring, more terrible, and more destructive to political stability than did the older motives of the national interest. A war fought in the name of high moral principle finds no early end short of some form of total domination. (Kennan 1951, 101)</em></p>
                  
                  <p>Kennan believes that the best way to maximise global wellbeing is for states to maximise their own interests, and he is not alone in this respect. The high-priest of post-war realism, Hans J. Morgenthau (1904 &#8211; 1980), blamed &#8216;sentimentalism&#8217; in foreign policy for the fact that &#8216;political success has been sacrificed without appreciable gain in universal morality&#8217;. According to Morgenthau, states lack both the will and the resources to pursue moral objectives to completion. As a result, &#8216;moralistic&#8217; doctrines are only ever implemented in &#8220;fits and starts&#8230; here half-heartedly and with insufficient means, there with all-out military commitments, there not at all&#8230;&#8221; (Morenthau 1951, 114) This leads to a sub-optimal outcome in terms of the national interest, without producing global benefits substantial enough to offset this sacrifice. The result is negative net utility overall.</p>
                  
                  <p>This argument for prescriptive realism is consequentialist or utilitarian in nature. It is concerned with prescribing norms that will deliver the &#8216;greatest happiness of the greatest number&#8217;. An alternative argument for prescriptive realism is deontological in character. Crudely, it says that a government breaches the trust of its own constituents by making foreign policy decisions based on anything but the national interest. In the international arena, where there is no overarching sovereign capable of enforcing rules of peaceful cooperation, it is reasonable (so this argument goes) to expect that each community will seek power in order to bolster its own security. In this highly competitive setting, a nation that allows moral considerations to interfere with its pursuit of power puts itself in danger by allowing potential aggressors to acquire a relative advantage in terms of position and resources, which can then be translated into a military advantage. This is a risk, prescriptive realists contend, that no political community can be obliged to take. We cannot be duty-bound to put our collective survival in jeopardy. Therefore, according to prescriptive realists, each nation is at liberty to promote its interests unfettered by moral constraints, and to empower an agent (the government) to do this on its behalf. This gives the government a fiduciary obligation to advance the national interest by any means necessary. Those are the terms of the social contract between the people and their government. Morgenthau puts it this way:</p>
                  
                  <p><em>The individual may say for himself: &#8216;Fiat justitia, pereat mundus&#8217; (Let justice be done, even if the worlds perish),&#8217; but the state has no right to say so in the name of those who are in its care. Both individual and state must judge political action by universal moral principles, such as that of liberty. Yet while the individual has a moral right to sacrifice himself in defence of such a moral principle, the state has no right to let its moral disapprobation of the infringement of liberty get in the way of successful political action, itself inspired by the moral principle of national survival. (Morgenthau and Thompson 1985, 166)</em></p>
                  
                  <p>What Morgenthau is saying is that the primary responsibility of any government is to ensure the security and wellbeing of its citizens, and morality&#8217;s intrusion into foreign policy interferes with the fulfilment of this responsibility. He thus reaches the conclusion that states have an obligation to act purely in the national interest, without regard to moral considerations.</p>

                  <p><a href=""https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/school-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/associate-professor-anthony-burke"">Anthony Burke</a></p>
                  
                  <p>The <em>jus ad bellum</em> are the rules governing the resort to force: when war may be waged, for what purposes, and under what conditions. It imposes a test of legitimacy&#8212;moral, political, or legal&#8212;which must be met. It is distinguished from the <em>jus in bello</em> [which we come to later] in that it is primarily concerned with the resort to war rather than its conduct, although it also prescribes general principles about that. The Just War Tradition links the <em>jus ad bellum</em> and the <em>jus in bello</em> together as important guides and test for force, insisting that both sets of rules be met for a conflict to be legitimate. Recent scholarship within the tradition has also added the categories of <em>jus ex bello</em> and <em>jus post bellum</em> which add further requirements for a war to be considered to be just.</p>
                  
                  <p>International law, which has been strongly informed by the Just War tradition, is more ambiguous. On the one hand, the International Humanitarian Law (IHL) set out in the Geneva Conventions and Protocols and a number of other weapons treaties, sets out rules for the conduct of war in great detail but is morally agnostic about the resort to force: this is simply a right that accrues to actors through the &#8216;combatant&#8217;s privilege&#8217;. On the other, the United Nations Charter sets out conditions for the legitimate and lawful resort to force between states&#8212;violations of which may soon be a major international crime if amendments to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court that define the crime of &#8216;aggression&#8217; come into effect after 2017. However, nothing in international law prevents a government using force within its own borders, or a non-state group beginning a campaign of violence or terror. The role of international law in force short of war&#8212;such as deterrence, coercive diplomacy, or sanctions&#8212;is unclear, but legal opinion is of the view that cyber-attacks, especially when they result in actual damage to property and human beings, are a form of force and are regulated by law (Gray 2004, 60-94; Burke et. al. 2014, 88-93; Schmitt et. al. 2013, 3).</p>
                  
                  <p>Just war theory states seven key criteria for the resort to force [<em>Note that in the video we stated that there are six criteria - that is because there we treated &#8216;public declaration&#8217; as an extension of just cause, rather than as a separate principle. Just War Theorists differ on this issue, but it is not a significant point</em>]. The first two state that war must be waged with the &#8216;right intention&#8217; and in a &#8216;just cause&#8217;. Rather than being waged for revenge or power-seeking, war should only be waged in self-defence, defence of others, for the restoration of rights, or to prevent and punish a wrong. It should also be a &#8216;last resort&#8217;, and have &#8216;a proportionality of ends&#8217;, so that the overall harm caused is less than the wrong being righted. This is an application of Thomas Aquinas&#8217; notion of the &#8216;double effect&#8217;, and critics have argued it lends itself to overly expansive interpretations that could support military adventurism. The war should also have &#8216;a reasonable chance of success&#8217;&#8212;one should not risk civilian and military life, along with costs to the treasury, without it&#8212;and be decided upon by a &#8216;right authority&#8217;. It should also be &#8216;publicly declared&#8217; (Bellamy 2006, Ch. 6). Formal declarations of war are rarely made now, and immense controversy exists over who a &#8216;right authority&#8217; is. Is it a state&#8212;and within that, is it a prime minister or president, a cabinet, or a parliament, and how much public dialogue and deliberation is appropriate? Or is it the United Nations?</p>
                  
                  <p>International law provides states with a right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter, but specifies that actions must be immediately reported to the Security Council, which should authorise the response and coordinate any further actions to resolve the dispute or continue the war. Thus, while understanding differing versions of state practice, international law specifies that the Security Council is the sole right authority. Chapters I and VII of the UN Charter set out a general normative prohibition on the interstate use of force, and underline the view that force is only permissible under special circumstances. The &#8216;last resort&#8217; and &#8216;just cause&#8217; criterion in particular are strong normative influences on UN decision-making about force, although some critics may argue that in many cases it has been a case less of &#8216;last&#8217; than &#8216;too late&#8217; resort. During the Cold War the Council was largely paralysed by superpower disagreement, but since 1989 has authorised force against Iraq to reverse its annexation of Kuwait, and in a number of cases (such as Libya, and East Timor) has authorised the use of force to prevent or stop mass atrocities. However in other cases, such as Rwanda, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Syria, it has failed to act or has provided weak mandates and forces. This is why the &#8220;Responsibility to Protect&#8221; doctrine was established to provide guidance to member states in cases of severe humanitarian crises or crimes against humanity. The original Responsibility to Protect report, concerned by the strong potential for Security Council inaction when a permanent member wishes to protect an ally or is reluctant to risk forces, suggested that the General Assembly could try to force action, but warned of the prospect that a coalition of states could be forced to act unilaterally, undermining the Council&#8217;s authority (ICISS 2001, 51). That would be a situation in which states could be forced to violate the &#8216;right authority&#8217; principle to fulfil the &#8216;just cause&#8217; principle of the <em>jus ad bellum</em>.</p>
                  
                  <p>In conclusion, we should recall the moral connection that the Just War tradition draws between the <em>jus ad bellum</em> and the <em>jus in bello</em>: its insistence that both sets of rules be satisfied, and that restraint in the resort to force underpins restraint in its use. This highlights the tragedy in the UN Charter&#8217;s failure to incorporate the intra-state resort to force into international law and collective security, which is starkly set out in the words of Article 2(7): &#8216;Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state&#8217;. Millions of people have died in intra-state wars since 1945, and terrible violations of humanitarian law have been committed with impunity, yet the international law of the <em>jus ad bellum</em> fell silent.</p>

                  <p>Today we have seen a new kind of pacifism emerge, sometimes called &#8216;contingent pacifism&#8217;, in which thinkers who agree in principle with the requirements of the <em>Jus ad Bellum</em> argue that in the real world no wars do, or (more strongly) can, meet those requirements, and so we therefore ought to adopt pacifism in practice.</p>

                  <p><strong><a href=""https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/school-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/prof-igor-primoratz"">Igor Primoratz</a>, Visiting Fellow in Ethics, UNSW Canberra<strong/></strong></p>
                  
                  <p>Just War Theory has traditionally been divided into two parts, <em>jus ad bellum</em> (which addresses the circumstances under which it is legitimate for a state to go to war), and <em>jus in bello</em> (which addresses the question of appropriate conduct by combatants engaged in a war). There are also two more recent categories that have been added to Just War Theory: <em>jus ex bello</em> and <em>jus post bellum</em>. The category of <em>jus in bello</em> is comprised of two principles, the principle of proportionality (which will be addressed later in the course and incorporates the principle of necessity, though that is sometimes treated as a third principle of <em>jus in bello</em>), and the principle of discrimination (or, in legal parlance, distinction).</p>
                  
                  <p>The principle of discrimination enjoins us to discriminate between legitimate and illegitimate targets in war and to restrict our attacks to the former. That means, roughly, that our acts of war must target only enemy soldiers and military facilities, and that we must not attack civilians. Civilians enjoy immunity against deliberately inflicted harm to life, limb, or property.</p>
                  
                  <p>The two main theories in the ethics of war, consequentialism and just war theory, offer different accounts of the grounds and stringency of civilian immunity.</p>
                  
                  <p>In consequentialist ethics of war, civilian immunity is not primarily a matter of civilians&#8217; acts or omissions, responsibility or lack of it. It is rather a useful rule, to be adopted because adopting it has good consequences. By prohibiting the targeting of a large group of humans, it helps reduce overall killing and destruction in war better than any alternative rule or no rule at all.</p>
                  
                  <p>This view is vulnerable to two main objections. First, the protection it offers to civilians is too weak. If all the moral force of civilian immunity derives from its utility, then it will have no such force in cases where it has no utility. There is no good consequentialist reason to comply with a moral rule in cases where compliance will not have the good consequences it usually has, and where better consequences will be attained by departing from it. This means that we ought to respect civilian immunity when, and only when, doing so will indeed reduce overall killing and destruction. But (following this consequentialist logic) whenever we have good reasons to believe that, by targeting civilians, we shall make a significant contribution to our war effort, thus shortening the war and reducing overall killing and destruction, that is what we may &#8211; and indeed ought to &#8211; do. Thus civilian immunity becomes hostage to the vagaries of war, instead of providing civilians with protection against them.</p>
                  
                  <p>Second, the consequentialist&#8217;s view misses what everyone else, and in particular civilians in wartime, would consider the main point of civilian immunity. Think of a civilian threatened with being killed or injured by enemy fire, who is allowed to present a case against such a fate. What kind of case would she make? Surely not one in terms of the utility of the rule that says that civilians ought not to be killed or injured in war. She would rather insist that she is a civilian, not a soldier; a bystander, not a participant; an innocent, not a guilty party. That is, she would point out that she has done nothing to deserve, or to become liable, to be targeted. And she would present these personal facts as considerations whose moral import is intrinsic and decisive, rather than instrumental and fortuitous, mediated by a useful rule &#8211; a rule which under different circumstances might call for limiting the killing and destruction by targeting only &#8220;soft&#8221; targets, that is, civilians. And the latter line of argument, made in personal terms, would carry greater force, and indeed be more to the point, than any impersonal balancing of good and bad consequences which would decide the issue for a consequentialist.</p>
                  
                  <p>In just war theory, civilian immunity is understood as a matter of justice and rights, rather than utility. The targeting of civilians is a violation of their rights, an injustice, and wrong in itself, rather than only on account of its consequences. The civilian status doesn&#8217;t in itself ground their immunity; but it is a good indication of their innocence. Civilians mustn&#8217;t be attacked, because they are innocent. They aren&#8217;t innocent in the sense of not being implicated in the war in any way at all. If that were the standard, in a modern war only a small part of civilian population would qualify: those who for whatever reason (age, infirmity, anti-war views) make no contribution whatsoever to the war effort. The word &#8220;innocent&#8221; comes from the Latin <em>nocere</em>, &#8220;to harm.&#8221; In mainstream just war theory, it refers to those who are &#8220;not harming.&#8221; All humans have a right not to be killed or injured to start with, and may be attacked only if they have waived or forfeited this right by some act or omission.</p>
                  
                  <p>One way of forfeiting this right is by joining the armed forces and fighting in war. Civilians don&#8217;t do this; therefore, although they may not be morally utterly innocent in relation to war, they aren&#8217;t &#8220;currently engaged in the business of war&#8221; (Walzer 2006, 43).</p>
                  
                  <p>To be sure, there seem to be borderline cases. What is the standing of a soldier when he isn&#8217;t performing any warlike activity because he is asleep, or on leave? What of a military chaplain? Or a medic? They don&#8217;t seem to be currently engaged in the business of war; are they legitimate targets because of the uniform they wear? What of a worker in an arms factory, or a scientist doing research necessary for developing military technology? What of a member of the government that oversees the prosecution of war? They seem to be engaged in the business of war; are they nevertheless protected, because they are civilians?</p>
                  
                  <p>Properly understood, Walzer&#8217;s wording provides answers to these questions. &#8220;Currently&#8221; shouldn&#8217;t be construed as &#8220;right now,&#8221; and &#8220;engaged in the business of war&#8221; shouldn&#8217;t be construed as &#8220;using arms in an attempt to kill, or issuing commands to someone who is doing that.&#8221; The &#8220;business of war&#8221; is a complex, collective, and prolonged activity. A soldier sleeping now will wake up later and resume his part in this business. Therefore he is a legitimate target when asleep too. The same goes for a soldier on leave. On the other hand, a badly injured soldier who is incapable of continuing to fight is considered to be hors de combat. This is a French term meaning literally &#8216;outside the fight&#8217; &#8211; in the terms we have been using here, such a soldier is no longer &#8216;engaged in the business of war&#8217;. Other combatants who are <em>hors de combat</em> include those who have been forced to parachute from seriously damaged aircraft, and those who are shipwrecked or adrift in a lifeboat.</p>
                  
                  <p>Members of the war cabinet wear no uniform and do no fighting; but they decide that others shall fight. Therefore they are legitimate targets. Workers in an arms factory wear no uniform and do no fighting, but what they produce is necessary for fighting. Therefore they too are legitimate targets. So are scientists doing war-related research. These civilians are &#8220;currently engaged in the business of war&#8221; and therefore don&#8217;t have immunity. But the vast majority of civilians in virtually any war do warrant immunity from attack. On the other hand, workers in a food factory mustn&#8217;t be attacked, even though what they produce is just as necessary for a fighting army as arms. For workers producing arms provide the means of fighting and cater to soldiers as soldiers. Workers producing food help feed soldiers as human beings, not as soldiers; they cater to a need humans have at all times, not only in war. The same can be said of military chaplains and medics. They are in uniform and are often impossible to distinguish from enemy soldiers proper; but whenever that is possible, they should not be harmed.</p>
                  
                  <p>The protection of civilians proffered by the laws of war, codified in particular in the Fourth Geneva Convention (1949) and its Additional Protocols (1977), is largely in line with that enjoined by just war theory. However, its scope is wider, since the term &#8220;civilians&#8221; is taken in a wider sense: it includes all those who aren&#8217;t combatants, that is, take no direct part in armed hostilities. Thus legal protection encompasses workers in arms factories, as well as political leaders who make strategic decisions concerning war.</p>
                  
                  <p>According to the current laws of war, the military must at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military facilities, and direct their operations only against the latter. Every person who is not a combatant is deemed to be a civilian; in cases of doubt, the status of civilian is to be presumed. Violence or threats of violence against civilians aiming at spreading terror among civilian population are prohibited. All attacks not directed at specific military targets, or using a method or means of combat that cannot be so directed, are deemed indiscriminate and are prohibited. Harm to civilians inflicted as a side-effect of attacks on legitimate military targets must not be disproportionate to the concrete and direct military advantage sought.</p>
                  
                  <p>Civilian immunity is obviously a highly important and very stringent moral rule. Is it absolute? Must we comply with it when that will result in losing the battle, or even losing the war? This question is discussed in Chapter 30 of <em>Key Concepts in Military Ethics</em>: Supreme Emergency.</p>
                  
                  <p>The present discussion focuses on the immunity of civilians against deliberately inflicted death or injury. In war civilians are also harmed without intent, but with foresight, as a side-effect of attacks on legitimate, military targets. Ethical issues posed by &#8220;collateral damage&#8221; are discussed later in the course.</p>

"5.5","Reading: Collateral damage and the doctrine of double effect","Article","","","Week 5","2016-03-28","28 Mar","Week 5: The conduct of war","https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/military-ethics/1/steps/57320","[<div class=""a-text-context a-text-context--bold-intro"">
                  <p><strong> Dr. Deane-Peter Baker, Ethics, UNSW Canberra<strong/></strong></p>
                  
                  <p>As discussed previously, the principle of discrimination requires that noncombatants not be targeted in war because they are, in the relevant sense, &#8216;innocent&#8217; &#8211; that is, they are not engaged in the business of war and therefore not liable to be killed. The sad reality, however, is that war is a messy business and civilians and other noncombatants are invariably among the bulk of the casualties of war. In the First World War, due to the static nature of the conflict, there were relatively few civilian deaths caused by military action. Since then, however, as military forces have become more mobile and irregular forces have increasingly sheltered within civilian populations, the ratio of civilian deaths to combatant deaths has increased alarmingly. Figures from the Iraq Body Count project, for example, put the proportion of civilian casualties in the Iraq war between 2003 and 2013 at 77%. While many of those deaths were the result of the deliberate targeting of civilians, and so constitute acts of murder or war crimes (depending on whether a domestic law or law of armed conflict paradigm is applied), many more of those deaths were either unintended and unforseen, or foreseen but unintended. The latter group of deaths falls into the category that is often referred to as &#8216;collateral damage&#8217;.</p>
                  
                  <p>If we are not to be pushed into either pacifism or realism then it is necessary to establish some ethical basis for dealing with the reality that it is nigh on impossible to engage in a significant armed conflict without causing any civilian casualties or causing any damage to non-military infrastructure. Here military ethicists have traditionally reached for a mechanism known as &#8216;the doctrine of double effect&#8217;. The origins of the doctrine stretch back to Thomas Aquinas, one of the founding figures of the Just War Theory. It is not, however, a doctrine that is restricted in its use to the military context, but is a general doctrine that is employed wherever it is necessary to ascertain whether a serious harm is a permissible side effect of some course of action. The doctrine of double effect has both deontological and consequentialist elements, and consists of the following four-step test:</p>
                  <ol>
                  <li>The act itself (i.e. the act that will result in the harm in question) is either a good or morally neutral act.</li>
                  <li>The act is intended to achieve the good effect that will result, not the bad effect. The test here is a counterfactual &#8211; would the act go ahead if the bad effect were not going to occur?</li>
                  <li>The good effect must not be caused by the bad effect.</li>
                  <li>The harm caused by the act must not be out of proportion to the good that will be achieved.</li>
                  </ol>
                  
                  <p>Consider, by way of illustration, a fictional example that nonetheless reflects a fairly common situation in contemporary armed conflict. Imagine that intelligence reports indicated, with a high degree of reliability, that a high-value target (HVT), in this case an influential and capable insurgent leader responsible for multiple atrocities, will be at a certain place at a certain time. Time constraints do not allow for the insertion of a Special Forces team to attempt to capture or, failing that, kill the HVT. The only targeting option available is to engage the HVT with an air-launched missile. Unfortunately the location where the HVT will be at the time when he can be targeted is in the middle of a village, and it is almost certain that some of the villagers will be killed in the strike (intelligence estimates are that there will be between five and twenty civilian casualties).</p>
                  
                  <p>In this fictional case, it is legitimate to go ahead with the strike on the HVT? The first test, according to the doctrine of double effect, is whether or not the act itself &#8211; launching the missile at the HVT &#8211; is either a good or morally neutral act. In this case it seems clearly that the answer is in the positive: the target is a legitimate target and failing to engage him now will likely result in further atrocities in the future. The second test asks whether the intentions of those ordering the strike are appropriate &#8211; is the intention to achieve the good effect, or the bad effect? In this case, again, it seems that the test is met, as the intention is clearly to kill the HVT &#8211; were it possible to kill the HVT without causing the death of any villagers, the strike would certainly still go ahead. Third, the good effect (killing the HVT) must not be a consequence of the bad effect. Again, the requirement is met &#8211; the deaths of the villagers do not cause the death of the HVT. Finally the doctrine of double effect requires an assessment of proportionality &#8211; is the death of the HVT of such importance that it outweighs the harm of causing the deaths of between five and twenty villagers? This is, in this case, the hardest question to answer, as there is no hard and fast rule for weighing proportionality.</p>
                  
                  <p>While the doctrine of double effect is widely considered to be an important means of distinguishing between permissible collateral damage and the unjustified killing of noncombatants, many analysts are sceptical about the doctrine. For some, the concern is that it places too much emphasis on intentions. While it is obviously a good thing that noncombatants are not intentionally targeted, it matters little to those who are killed, and their loved ones, that their deaths were &#8216;foreseen but not intended&#8217; rather than directly intended. So is this really a strong enough basis on which to rest a distinction between permissible and impermissible killing of noncombatants? Others are concerned that too much rests on how the act is described. In the above example if the act is described as firing a missile at a high-value enemy combatant then that seems perfectly appropriate, whereas if the act is described as firing a missile at the market district of a village then that seems far less morally acceptable. But these are two equally plausible descriptions of exactly the same act.</p>

                  <p><strong><a href=""http://anu-au.academia.edu/AdamGastineau"">Adam C. Gastineau</a>, Tutor in Military Ethics, UNSW Canberra<strong/></strong></p>
                  
                  <p>In this reading we will look at two <em>jus in bello</em> constraints that restrict the amount of force combatants are permitted to use during armed conflict. If the principle of Discrimination determines whom we can kill and what we can break, Proportionality and Necessity determine the amount of damage we may permissibly do. In traditional Just War Theory these two constraints are often combined in discussion of the <em>jus in bello</em> Proportionality principle. However, for greater clarity, I will pull them apart here.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Proportionality</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>Proportionality <em>in bello</em> is similar to the <em>jus ad bellum</em> proportionality constraint in that both require that the harm caused not be greater than the (expected) benefit to be gained as a result of that harm. The difference lies in which benefits and harms are to be considered. In <em>jus ad bellum</em> the benefits in question are those that will arise from the successful achievement of the Just Cause, and the harms are all harms that will result if the group making the calculation decides to go to war to achieve these benefits. Such harms include broad harms resulting from going to war: harm to the world economy, to future relations between countries, to the stability of the world political order etc.</p>
                  
                  <p><em>Jus in bello</em> proportionality is narrower in scope. In this application, one must weigh the harms caused by some particular military action against the benefits derived from that action. So, for example, if we are concerned with determining whether or not an attack against an arms factory is proportionate <em>in bello</em>, we must compare the harms done by the destruction of the factory (death of the non-combatant workers inside the factory, destruction of surrounding civilian infrastructure or buildings and other collateral damage) against the benefits of destroying that factory (reduction in the enemy&#8217;s capability to wage war, reduction in the risk that our combatants will be harmed by these particular weapons, etc.).</p>
                  
                  <p>There are a couple of things that must be noted about this constraint. First, the moral constraint in Just War Theory is not identical to the legal constraint that exists in international law. The moral proportionality constraint factors in all harms resulting from the military act in question and compares those to the expected benefit. The legal constraint only takes into account resultant harms done to non-combatants, while constraints on harms done to combatants fall under the legal constraint of military necessity. The Just War constraints offer some grounds for this distinction, as harms done to combatants have less effect on proportionality calculations than harms done to civilians <em>prima facie</em>, but often the <em>in bello</em> necessity constraint is included in the proportionality constraint as harms to both combatants and non-combatants have an effect on proportionality.</p>
                  
                  <p>Secondly, both the harms and benefits are morally weighted. This means that harms to non-combatants that result from a particular act press down more strongly against the benefits expected than harms done to combatants. Thomas Hurka has offered an interesting analysis of how this might work. (Hurka 2005) He argues that when we calculate proportionality we must take into consideration not only the combatant/non-combatant status of those harmed, but also any additional duties the state might have to protect them. This means that harms that befall &#8216;our&#8217; non-combatants have the greatest moral weight, followed by harms done to enemy (&#8216;their&#8217;) non-combatants, then harms done to friendly/our combatants, and finally harms done to enemy combatants. He points out that it may be the case that the harms done to opposing non-combatants may have equal moral weight to the harms done to our own combatants because of the moral duties of protection that a state owes to its members.</p>
                  
                  <p>This is an interesting idea as it raises questions about collateral damage, force protection, and how much harm a state or commander might do to enemy civilians in order to protect the combatants under their command. Regardless of whether or not Hurka is correct, the constraint still forbids an agent from committing a military action that will result in greater harm than benefit if achieved. If the morally weighted harms are greater than the benefits of a particular military action, then one is not permitted to engage in that military action.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Necessity</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>As mentioned the necessity constraint is often incorporated into the proportionality constraint in Just War Theory. While these two criteria are similar in the respect that they require one to weigh the harms resulting from a particular action against the benefits expected as a result of that action, they differ in an important respect. Proportionality calculations weigh the overall benefit of doing a particular action against doing nothing at all. Necessity calculations weigh two or more means of achieving a particular benefit.</p>
                  
                  <p>The common definition of Necessity found in discussion of both military ethics and the literature on ethically permissible use of force in self-defense can be summed up in the following way: A use of force is necessary, if and only if, that use of force is the least harmful means of averting the harm being threatened. At first brush this seems fairly straightforward. However, on closer examination such a principle is incredibly vague. What do we mean by &#8216;least harmful&#8217; and harmful to whom? How are we to evaluate what means are available to the agent or agents using force? What if the least harmful means only has a small chance of averting the threat? Are we still obligated to try it before we utilize more harmful methods? The pre-theoretic principle of Necessity leaves all of these questions open to interpretation. A clearer definition is required.</p>
                  
                  <p>Seth Lazar has offered just such a definition. He defines Necessity as follows:</p>
                  
                  <p>&#8220;Necessity: Defensive harm H is necessary to avert unjustified threat T if and only if a reasonable agent with access to the evidence available to Defender would judge that there is no less harmful alternative, such that the marginal risk of morally weighted harm in H compared with that in the alternative is not justified by a countervailing marginal reduction in risked harm to the prospective victims of T.&#8221; (Lazar 2012, 13)</p>
                  
                  <p>Setting aside the technical terminology, this definition answers three important questions left open by the pre-theoretic definition of the constraint. First it tells us that necessity calculations are to be made on the basis of the evidence available to the decision maker. This means that when evaluating a particular act <em>in bello</em>, what matters is the evidence that was available to the decision maker at the time the decision occurred. It also means that when choosing between two or more means of achieving a military objective, one must consider <em>all</em> available evidence, not just evidence that supports a given reasonable belief held by the decision maker. This definition also stresses the importance of the risk of failing to avert the threatened harm. If a less harmful means significantly increases the risk of failure without reducing the risk of harm threatened, then that means can be disregarded under this definition of necessity: even when that means is less harmful than other alternatives. Finally, this definition includes all agents who might be harmed by the action, thus answering questions about which harms we should be concerned with when determining if an act does or does not fall within the necessity constraint. If my defensive act will foreseeably harm both my attacker and some bystander, I am required to include the morally weighted harms suffered by the bystander into my assessment of that means of defence.</p>
                  
                  <p>However, Lazar argues that the individual principle outlined by this definition cannot be directly applied in warfare because of two main problems. First, it is incredibly difficult for a combatant <em>in bello</em> to do the necessary moral weighing in order to determine whether or not the harms they do in defence of themselves and their colleagues are outweighed by the harms they are seeking to avert. Secondly, the collective nature of armed conflict makes it impossible to apply the same constraint in both self-defence and armed conflict. Because of these two problems the necessity constraint <em>in bello</em> would need to be much less stringent than the self-defense constraint, assuming that lethal force in armed conflict is permissible. The definition is the same in both cases, but as Lazar argues, the &#8216;collective necessity&#8217; constraint must relaxed to allow for the fog of war and the collective nature of armed conflict.</p>
                  
                  <p>Something must also be said about the benefits being considered under Lazar&#8217;s definition of the necessity constraint <em>in Bello</em>. &#8216;Benefit&#8217; in such cases is equivalent with the military advantage gained from a particular military action. Lazar worries that defining benefit in this way would result in the necessity constraint being overly permissive: that any slight military advantage gained could justify doing a great amount of harm in order to slightly reduce the risk of failure. If we take a narrow view of what constitutes a military advantage then this is certainly a valid concern. However, if we take a view of military advantage that makes &#8216;advantage&#8217; relative to the Just Cause (thereby tying this <em>jus in bello</em> constraint to a principle of the <em>jus ad bellum</em>), equating military advantage with benefit <em>in bello</em> becomes less of an ethical concern. However, doing this would mean that combatants &#8216;on the ground&#8217; would need to have a clear idea of what that Just Cause was so that they could effectively determine what was advantageous and what was not.</p>

                  <p><strong>Rhiannon Neilsen, Tutor, UNSW Canberra<strong/></strong></p>
                  
                  <p>This chapter explains perfidy and means <em>mala in se</em> in the context of just armed conflicts. The <em>jus in bello</em> principle of discrimination asserts that (in most circumstances) combatants are legitimate targets of hostile engagement, whereas non-combatants (such as civilians, medical and religious personnel, employees of the United Nations and Red Cross/Red Crescent, and the <em>hors de combat</em>) are apportioned protection. Unfortunately, combatants have been known to intentionally cheat their adversary into falsely awarding them the status of non-combatants so as to gain a military advantage, therein committing one of the gravest ethical and law of war violations &#8211; perfidy.</p>
                  
                  <p>Article 37 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions defines perfidy as &#8216;acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him [sic] to believe that he [sic] is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence&#8217;. Thus, a perfidious act is one that purposely deceives the adversary into believing the attacker is deserving of immunity in accordance with the laws of armed conflict (LOAC), but then exploits the adversary&#8217;s respect of LOAC for unfair military gain.</p>
                  
                  <p>As such, perfidy has three essential elements: an offer, an acceptance, and a betrayal (Watts 2014, 147-159). First, an attacker asks the adversary &#8211; verbally or by appearance (for example, by disguising him/herself as a civilian, or appearing to make a genuine attempt to surrender, or feigning serious injury) &#8211;to disqualify the attacker as a legitimate target of conflict, and instead afford him/her forbearance or protection in accordance with LOAC. Next, abiding by the ethical and lawful proscription of harming non-combatants, the adversary accepts the invitation by showing restraint or guaranteeing the attacker&#8217;s security. Finally, in the adversary&#8217;s moment of vulnerability or exposure that has been generated by granting the attacker asylum, the attacker betrays this confidence by killing, maiming or apprehending the enemy. This betrays an important trust that is one means by which to limit unnecessary bloodshed in war. Article 37 thus states that it is prohibited to &#8216;kill, injure or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy&#8217;.</p>
                  
                  <p>It is important to recognize that immoral and illegal acts of perfidy are distinct from ruses of war, which are generally considered to be legally and morally acceptable. Although ruses are, too, acts of deception, they &#8216;do not hinge on an enemy&#8217;s compliance (by according an adversary certain protections) with the law of armed conflict&#8217; (Greene 2010, 45) only to have that observance of and confidence in just war laws betrayed.</p>
                  
                  <p>The ramifications of perfidy affect not just the victim combatants immediately involved, but also the integrity of the just war tradition. Perfidious betrayals erode respect for, and the implementation of, the <em>jus in bello</em> principles and associated elements of LOAC that protect the impunity of non-combatants. Hence, perfidy endangers those who are legitimately entitled to protection in armed conflict, and, if it continues, the mandatory protection of non-combatants may cease to be respected altogether (Coleman 2013, 231). (A harrowing example of this was reported by a U.S. Army Major, who, disillusioned by repeated perfidy by Iraqi insurgents in 2003, stated that &#8216;we were 100 per cent sure that everyone to our front was enemy, and we were coming through to kill everything we possibly could&#8217; (quoted in Watts 2014, 111)).</p>
                  
                  <p>The prospect of resolving war and returning to peace is also degraded by perfidy. Acts of treachery in war dilute the trust and good faith between warring parties, and it is upon this confidence and sincerity of intention that armistices, ceasefires, negotiations and, indeed, the end of war depend (Watts 2014, 172). For these reasons, perfidy is ethically and legally prohibited in the conduct of war, as are means <em>mala in se</em>.</p>
                  
                  <p>Distinct from <em>mala prohibita</em>, which refers to acts that are wrong only because they are not permitted by the laws of the state, <em>mala in se</em>, &#8216;evil in itself&#8217;, speaks to conduct that is held as inherently immoral, irrespective of rules or laws governing regulating such behaviour (Dige 2012, 319). According to just war theory, combatants are never permitted to resort to means or weapons <em>mala in se</em>, which category includes rape campaigns, torture, the use of weapons that produce an effect that are indiscriminate and cannot be controlled (such as biological and chemical weapons), and genocide (Dige 2012, 319; Fiala 2008, 9). Thus, even if other conditions of <em>jus in bello</em> are met, combatants are forbidden from using such intrinsically evil or immoral means in warfare (Fiala 2008, 9). This is because no level of morality permits the use of means assessed to be axiomatically wicked in themselves: indeed, means <em>mala in se</em> constitute a &#8216;shock to the moral conscience of mankind&#8217; (Walzer 1977, 107, quoted in Dige 2012, 318).</p>
                  
                  <p>In short, perfidy is the deliberate, deceitful manipulation of the enemy&#8217;s respect for the <em>jus in bello</em> principle of discrimination, to the end of gaining a military advantage. Means <em>mala in se</em> refer to methods and weapons that are considered <em>a priori</em> nefarious or &#8216;wrong&#8217; in themselves. Because both are regarded as deeply unethical, combatants are required to abstain from their use in just armed conflicts.</p>

                  <p>This week we take a step back from the ethical questions surrounding the application of military force to consider the legitimacy of the military as it relates to society at large.</p>
                  
                  <p>We begin by thinking through the fundamental moral foundation of the military profession, which we argue rests on the concept of the social contract.</p>
                  
                  <p>We then explore the concept of civil-military relations, which defines the appropriate relationship between the military and the civilian government.</p>
                  
                  <p>The week&#8217;s third topic is the contentious idea of conscription, and we explore the arguments both for and against this practice. Finally we consider the challenging ethical balance that must be struck between the military and the media.</p>

                  <p><strong><a href=""https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/school-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/dr-peter-balint"">Dr. Peter Balint</a>, International and Political Science, UNSW Canberra<strong/></strong></p>
                  
                  <p>Let&#8217;s assume you serve in the military. Your superiors tell you what to wear, where to go, which activities you must do, and which ones you are forbidden from undertaking. If you don&#8217;t comply with these orders, you can either be forced or punished - both of which are backed by coercive force. Why is this legitimate? And how it any different from being kidnapped by terrorists who wish to play soldiers?</p>
                  
                  <p>One answer (assuming you are not a conscript) is that you actively <em>consented</em> to this relationship (as we discussed when we considered the ideas of Role Morality and the Unlimited Liability Contract). In most modern militaries, you will have both literally &#8216;signed up&#8217;, as well as swore a public oath of allegiance. The power that is wielded against you is legitimate because you agreed to it. This agreement even includes occasions when disagree with what you are being asked to do. This isn&#8217;t to say it&#8217;s never okay to resist (as we&#8217;ll see when we consider Illegal Orders and Whistle-Blowing), just that you can be legitimately forced to do something you don&#8217;t want to do - and all because of your initial agreement.</p>
                  
                  <p>You may wonder what all this has to do with <em>the social contract</em>. The question that political theorists have grappled with for centuries is, &#8216;what makes political power legitimate?&#8217; Why is it okay for the state and those who serve it to tell you what to do, force you to pay taxes, and fine and even jail you for non-compliance? If any other group or institution tried to do this sort of thing we would think it outrageous and probably akin to a kind of slavery (in fact the political theorist Robert Nozick (1938 &#8211; 2002) famously argued that taxation levied by the state is a form of partial slavery (Nozick 1974), but as that&#8217;s a minority view we&#8217;ll set it aside here). What&#8217;s so special then about our relationship to our own political community that can justify such force potentially being used against us?</p>
                  
                  <p>One answer might be that emotion and identity ties us together. We feel national pride, feel connected with others who we have never met and who may live half a continent away, and identify that we are one &#8216;people&#8217;. This is certainly true of many of us, particularly those who feel patriotic. But not all us feel this tie, and many who do feel this tie of national identification still get quite upset when they are forced to do things they don&#8217;t want to (such as pay taxes, drive to the speed limit, or report for jury duty). National identification does not fully explain the relationship.</p>
                  
                  <p>A more practical answer might be that the state has all the power, and you&#8217;d be stupid not to follow their orders. This is true. Disobeying orders from your state or its agents is pretty dangerous. But if it&#8217;s just a matter of holding the guns, then our state starts to look very similar to a bunch of thugs. If somebody pulls a gun on you, you&#8217;re going to do what they say. It would be good if there&#8217;s more to state power than this.</p>
                  
                  <p>The most famous answer to this question of legitimate political power is the one given by Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau: consent. That is, we have somehow agreed to have this power wielded over us. Importantly, unlike the military case, the agreement is not between us and our states, but between us and our fellow citizens; our political community. This is what makes it a <em>social</em> contract. The contract ties us to our fellow citizens and makes us subject to the form and content of the political community&#8217;s collective decision-making. The contract gives us a special relationship with our fellow citizens, and provides a reason why we may owe more to our fellow citizens than distant foreigners (something that is hard to justify if the moral equality of individuals is accepted). So the reason the state can tell us what to do and the reason we have a special relationship with our fellow citizens is because we said &#8216;yes I agree to be in this relationship!&#8217;</p>
                  
                  <p>At this point, many of you might be thinking &#8216;I never agreed to this! When did I sign up? Where&#8217;s my contract?&#8217; And this is a big problem. It is true that most of us, at least those born in the country we now live is, never did give <em>express consent</em> to anything at all. That doesn&#8217;t apply to everyone, though. Anyone who has gone through a citizenship ceremony - that is, migrants - certainly has expressly consented.</p>
                  
                  <p>But for the majority of the population who were born in the country where they now reside, the problem remains. Social contract theorists try to show two other ways in which we can be said to have consented. The first is that while we may not have sworn allegiance or signed a contract, we&#8217;ve done lots of things that show we agree with this relationship. We&#8217;ve driven on the roads, voted in elections, and perhaps just not moved to another country. We have demonstrated <em>tacit consent</em>.</p>
                  
                  <p>The problem here is that for consent to be legitimate, it must be intentional. Otherwise, you could unwittingly consent to all sorts of things. For consent to be valid, we need for it to be clear which actions demonstrate consent and what is actually being consented to - something that cannot be said driving on roads or voting in elections etc. 
                  It also matters that the consent is voluntary. When a mugger holding a gun says &#8216;give me your phone and wallet or I&#8217;ll shoot you&#8217;, it would be strange to say you have consented to giving these items away. Most of you think you didn&#8217;t really have a choice. (The political theorist Thomas Hobbes (1588 &#8211; 1679) is the exception here - for him, &#8216;your money or your life&#8217; is a free choice!) Likewise, what choice does someone born and raised in a particular country have to leave it, or at least not without some very high costs?</p>
                  
                  <p>The second strategy used by social contract theorists to demonstrate consent by all of the population is <em>hypothetical</em>. The argument here is that once we realise how bad life would be living outside of the state - in Hobbes&#8217; famous words &#8216;nasty, brutish, and short&#8217; - then it would be entirely rational for us to consent. Perhaps it would be rational, but the idea of hypothetical consent is controversial. As the American political theorist Ronald Dworkin 1921 &#8211; 2013) put it: &#8216;A hypothetical contract is not merely a pale form of an actual contract; it is no contract at all.&#8217; (Dworkin 1997, 186)</p>
                  
                  <p>Despite these problems with using the social contract to legitimise state power, the idea that we&#8217;ve somehow agreed remains the most popular explanation of why we&#8217;re tied to our fellow citizens, and why it&#8217;s okay that the state can force us to do things. The social contract is also a significant part of what explains the state&#8217;s right to use force against others &#8211; that is, a state can raise and employ military forces. Under the social contract we agree to allow the state to take over, and exercise on our behalf, our basic rights to defend ourselves, our property and one another. To do that the state needs the means to not only protect us from one another (which is what the police and legal system are for) but also from outside attackers. So in an important sense a good part of the justification for the existence of the military can be said to come from the social contract.</p>

"6.5","Reading: Civil-military relations","Article","","","Week 6","2016-04-04","4 Apr","Week 6: The military and society","https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/military-ethics/1/steps/57339","[<div class=""a-text-context a-text-context--bold-intro"">
                  <p><strong>Dr. Deane-Peter Baker, Ethics, UNSW Canberra</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>There are essentially two ways to understand the concept of civil-military relations, one broad, and one narrow. The broad interpretation of civil-military relations is that it describes the relationship between the military and civilian society in general. The narrow interpretation of the term focuses on the relationship between the military and the civil authority (government) of the society in question. While much of the research related to this issue focuses on empirical questions, this chapter will briefly discuss the central ethical questions related to civil-military relations.</p>
                  
                  <p>In terms of the broad interpretation of civil military-relations, a key concept is the idea of the &#8216;civil-military gap&#8217;. This is the notion that because of the unique role and norms of the military profession, there exists an inevitable separation between the military and the society it serves. As Richard Kohn points out, &#8216;The military is, by necessity, among the least democratic institutions in human experience; martial customs and procedures clash by nature with individual freedom and civil liberty, the highest values in democratic societies&#8217; (Kohn 1997:141) In one sense this gap seems not only inevitable, but necessary &#8211; an excessively &#8216;civilianised&#8217; military would, many scholars argue, result in an ineffectual military, which would represent a failure of the military to play its role as mandated by the social contract. On the other hand, if the civil-military gap grows too wide there is a danger that the military will lose sight of its role as a servant of society at large, and will instead seek to become society&#8217;s master. When this happens, military <em>coups d&#8217;etat</em> can occur, often with tragic results. Military dictatorships are, with few exceptions, associated with oppression and human rights abuses.</p>
                  
                  <p>Keeping the civil-military gap from growing too large is, therefore, ethically important. One positive factor in this regard is a society that appropriately recognizes and honours its military servants through such things as national rituals (such as public holidays and events that recognize the honourable sacrifice of past and present members of the military), adequate provision of medical care and other benefits for serving and retired members of the military, and the like. Historically the practice of conscription (which we consider next in the course) has been viewed as playing an important role in keeping society &#8216;in touch&#8217; with the military. This practice has, however, largely fallen away in most liberal democracies, though a growing dependence on military reservists might perhaps compensate for this to some degree.</p>
                  
                  <p>The narrower interpretation of civil-military relations (the issue of the relationship between the military and the civilian government) is sometimes described in terms of &#8216;the democratic control of armed forces&#8217;. The assumption built into this terminology is that only democracy can ensure the kind of relationship between society and the state that is required by the social contract. The military, while playing an important role in advising the elected leadership, is expected to respond to civilian direction regardless of whether or not the military agrees with that direction. As Peter Feaver puts it, regarding military affairs, &#8216;in a democracy, civilians have the right to be wrong&#8217; (Feaver 2003:65). There are two aspects of the democratic control of armed force. There is, firstly, the question of ensuring that the elected government is accountable to the will of the electorate in its use of armed force. This is why in the United States only Congress has the power to declare war, and why many analysts argue that it is problematic that the President has the power to employ military force without a declaration of war.</p>
                  
                  <p>The second aspect of this narrower interpretation of civil-military relations (the democratic control of armed forces) is the question of ensuring that the military remains subservient and responsive to the nation&#8217;s elected civilian leadership. The two key academic figures who have addressed this question are Samuel P. Huntington and Morris Janowitz in their landmark books <em>The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations</em>(Huntington 1957) and <em>The Professional Soldier: A Social and Political Portrait</em> (Janowitz 1960). Central to the theory of both Huntington and Janowitz is the concept of military professionalism. It is professionalism that ensures (in Huntington&#8217;s terminology) &#8216;objective civilian control&#8217;, which involves:</p>
                  
                  <ol>
                    <li>a high level of military professionalism and recognition by military officers of the limits of their professional competence;</li>
                    <li>the effective subordination of the military to the civilian political leaders who make the basic decisions on foreign and military policy;</li>
                    <li>the recognition and acceptance by that leadership of an area of professional competence and autonomy for the military; and</li>
                    <li>as a result, the minimization of military intervention in politics and of political intervention in the military (Huntington 1995:9-10)</li>
                  </ol>
                  
                  <p>Janowitz&#8217;s analysis is more sociological than Huntington&#8217;s, and the two approaches can be read as being largely complementary. The main area of difference between these two thinkers is that Huntington strongly advocated for a clear separation between the values of the military and those of the society they serve, which he believed to be essential for military effectiveness, while Janowitz argued that it is important that the values of the military reflect those of the society they serve.</p>
                  
                  <p>More recently another important view of civil-military relations has arisen, Peter Feaver&#8217;s &#8216;agency theory&#8217;. While not disputing that military professionalism is an important factor in securing appropriate civil-military relations, Feaver points out that in practice states make use of a range of other tools to ensure military compliance. Basing his theory on &#8216;principal-agent theory&#8217; (as employed in economics and other similar fields) Feaver starts with the observation that there exists an inescapable state of strategic tension between the preferences of the state&#8217;s civilian leadership and those of the military. Using terminology borrowed from principal-agent theory, Feaver argues that the preference of the civilian leaders or principals is that the military &#8216;work&#8217;, while the preference of the military is to &#8216;shirk&#8217;. &#8216;Working&#8217;, in this context, does not simply mean doing something but rather doing what matches the preferences of the civilian principals, while &#8216;shirking&#8217; is failing to do so. Thus a military force can be very active, engaged in all sorts of projects and even wars, but still, in this sense, be shirking.</p>
                  
                  <p>Feaver argues that civilian principals have available, and employ, a range of means to try to ensure that the military is working rather than shirking. These include forms of monitoring and punishment such as restricting the scope of delegation to the military; contractual incentives (relating to granting autonomy to the military within the scope of its areas of expertise); screening and selection mechanisms; &#8216;fire alarms&#8217; (e.g. think tanks and the media that report on the military); &#8216;police patrols&#8217; (such as government investigations of the military); revocation of delegated authority; budget cuts and withdrawal of privileges; forced detachment from the military; military justice; and extralegal civilian action.</p>
                  
                  <p>An important aspect of Feaver&#8217;s theory is that it describes means that are available to civilian principals to hold their state&#8217;s military forces accountable where those forces do not have an established ethic of professionalism and subservience to elected civilian principals, as is the case, for example, in new democracies or where states have disbanded and reformed their military forces. None of this, however, undermines the ethical imperative for military personnel to strive towards the kind of professionalism described by Huntington and Janowitz.</p>

"6.7","Reading: Conscription","Article","","","Week 6","2016-04-04","4 Apr","Week 6: The military and society","https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/military-ethics/1/steps/57340","[<div class=""a-text-context a-text-context--bold-intro"">
                  <p><strong>Dr. Deane-Peter Baker, Ethics, UNSW Canberra</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>Conscription &#8211; also referred to variously as &#8216;national service&#8217; or (in the United States) &#8216;the draft&#8217; &#8211; is a form of mandatory service to the state, usually military service, which is imposed on citizens and which is legally enforced.</p>
                  
                  <p>The modern practice of conscription dates back to beginning of the 19th Century, during the period of the French Revolution, when the new French Republic found itself under attack by Europe&#8217;s monarchies. Unable to match the quality of the professional forces of France&#8217;s opponents, Napoleon Bonaparte opted instead for quantity, conscripting millions of Frenchmen into his <em>Grande Arm&#233;e</em> (Great Army) in what became known as the <em>lev&#233;e en masse</em> (mass mobilization). This advantage in manpower gave Napoleon such an advantage that most major powers quickly followed suit and introduced conscription themselves. Conscription reached its apogee in the Second World War, with most of the major powers employing conscription as a means to populate the massive armies needed to prosecute that conflict.</p>
                  
                  <p>Today conscription is on the wane as quality has once again taken the ascendency and the increasing sophistication of modern warfare increasingly demands a level of expertise and professionalism that is easier to achieve in an all-volunteer force. Nonetheless there remain important exceptions, such as Israel and Singapore, and many countries that no longer conscript their citizens into the military retain the legal right to do so should the government decide that circumstances make it necessary. In the first decade of the 21st Century the United States controversially applied a policy known as &#8216;stop loss&#8217; to tens of thousands of its troops. This policy forces volunteer military personnel to stay on active duty beyond the period of service defined in their employment contracts. Many critics saw stop loss as a form of &#8216;backdoor&#8217; conscription, though this has been countered by those who point out that US servicemen and women accept the possibility that stop loss will be applied to them when they sign up for military service.</p>
                  
                  <p>Those in favour of conscription argue that, apart from the military capability it brings (a subject of considerable debate), there are moral and social reasons why conscription should be in place. First, proponents argue, conscription satisfies a moral duty that rests on all citizens to play their part in ensuring the security of the state. Because all citizens benefit from the safety that an effective state military apparatus brings, all (so the argument goes) should be willing to play their part &#8211; and if necessary risk their lives &#8211; in order to contribute to the defence of the state and its interests. Furthermore, proponents contend, conscription plays an important role in <em>nation building</em>. Through mandatory military service individual citizens from different backgrounds are brought together and form a common identity through a shared commitment to serving their fellow citizens. It is also argued that, because conscript armies bring the military closer to society in general, states with conscript armies will be less likely to engage in risky, and perhaps unjustified, military ventures because conscript casualties will be felt more keenly in society than the deaths of volunteer professionals.</p>
                  
                  <p>In response, critics point out that conscription fails to ensure that all citizens fulfil their moral duty to one another (even if it were accepted that such a duty includes the duty to risk one&#8217;s life, which is controversial) because conscription is almost never applied fairly to all citizens. For one thing, with few exceptions, conscription is applied only to men. Furthermore, in practice, the burden of conscription falls more heavily onto lower economic classes, as the wealthy have the resources to enable them to &#8216;work the system&#8217; to have their young men either avoid military service or be assigned to roles or units that ensured that they are unlikely to see combat. During the Vietnam war, for example, some units were given the informal title of &#8216;Champagne units&#8217; because of the high proportion of young men from wealthy and well connected families that were assigned to them.</p>
                  
                  <p>The strongest argument against conscription is that it represents an illegitimate violation of the individual&#8217;s right to liberty and, potentially, the individual&#8217;s right to life. Furthermore, mandatory military service also violates the individual&#8217;s right to act on his (or occasionally her) conscience. While many states that have practiced or do practice conscription allow for waivers or alternative forms of service to be granted in the case of conscientious objectors who object in general to participating in war (this is usually, but not always, restricted to those whose pacifism rests on religious grounds), the right of conscripts to selective conscientious objection &#8211; in which the person concerned objects not to war in general but to the justice of the specific war or conflict which he or she is being called to participate in &#8211; is only recognized in law on one country in the world, Australia.</p>

                  <p><strong>Dr. Deane-Peter Baker, Ethics, UNSW Canberra<strong/></strong></p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>&#8220;Journalism and patriotic responsibility are fractious bedfellows at the best of times. And war is both the best and worst of times for newspapers. Best, because it is real drama and a real chance for reporters to achieve fame and fortune. In the huff and puff of propaganda and misleading military briefings, the journalist can claim the high ground of truth and objectivity. And yet it&#8217;s the worst of times because once one&#8217;s own soldiers are involved, one cannot pretend to have no regard for the consequences&#8221; (Hamilton 2001, 8).</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>These words by the respected British journalist Adrian Hamilton sum up, from the perspective of journalists, the ethical challenge that media engagement with the military poses. Journalists have a fundamental responsibility to report the truth as objectively as possible, but at the same time there is a responsibility to ensure that reporting is responsible, and doesn&#8217;t cause unnecessary or undue harm. This challenge is particularly acute when journalists are engaged in reporting on military operations &#8211; the public has a right to know what is going on, but at the same time careless reporting can potentially cost lives.</p>
                  
                  <p>There is more that could be said about the ethical responsibilities of members of the media in engaging with the military, but this book is first and foremost about the ethical responsibilities of military personnel. Military personnel are often suspicious of members of the media, and reluctant to cooperate with them. While the US military&#8217;s program of embedding journalists with forces in the field in recent decades has improved attitudes somewhat in that force, other nations&#8217; armed forces remain hostile. For example, according to the media analyst Kevin Foster, members of the Australian Defence Force remain in general convinced that &#8220;the media&#8217;s principal reason for wanting access to the battlefield was to sniff out scandal, to smear and to slander&#8221; (Foster 2013). While there is undoubtedly some truth to this view, the fact remains that as the armed servants of the state members of the military, and the military itself, are accountable to the citizenry of the state, and the media plays a critical role in assuring that accountability. Put in the terms of Peter Feaver&#8217;s Agency Theory of civil-military relations (discussed previously), the media plays the role of a &#8216;fire alarm&#8217; which alerts the public and the elected leaders of a democracy to ways in which the military might be &#8216;shirking&#8217; its responsibility to serve at the behest of those who the electorate have placed in authority over it. This is an uncomfortable reality for the military, but a reality nonetheless. An honourable military and its personnel will be prepared to bite the bullet and, genuine considerations of national security permitting, open themselves to media scruitiny.</p>
                  
                  <p>That is enough of a challenge in peacetime, but even more difficult in war. The statement, variously attributed to the ancient Greek playwright Aeschylus and the US Senator Hiram Johnson, that &#8216;the first casualty of war is truth&#8217;, illustrates the depth of the challenge. Deception is a fundamental aspect of military operations. As the great military strategist Carl von Clausewitz wrote, &#8220;to take the enemy by surprise &#8230; is more or less basic to all operations, for without it superiority at the decisive point is hardly conceivable.&#8221; (Clausewitz 1984, 198) Deceiving the enemy is, with some exceptions such as perfidy aside, generally an acceptable practice in war, but is it appropriate to mislead the media in order to do so? The importance of respecting the public&#8217;s trust in the military is a key, and in most cases, overriding consideration. Where there may be exceptions to the general rule of dealing truthfully with the media, these should be approached with considerable caution, perhaps employing the ethical framework of the Doctrine of Double Effect.</p>

                  <p><strong>Dr. Richard Adams, Adjunct Senior Lecturer in Ethics, UNSW Canberra</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>This chapter explores some of the moral challenges associated with uninhabited aerial systems &#8211; sometimes described by the colloquialism &#8220;drones&#8221;. The drone typifies the changing character of conflict, which is examined by the philosopher Tony Coady in his book, <em>Morality and Political Violence</em>, Coady observes that:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><em>The last quarter of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty first century have seen a dramatic decline in warfare understood as direct state-versus-state conflict, and a proportionate increase in other forms of warfare such as revolutionary and secessionist war; client war&#8230; [and] violent terrorist attacks like that of September 11 and the &#8216;war on terror&#8217; it provoked and so on. (Coady 2011, 4)</em></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>Coady is not alone in recognizing the changing character of war and the rise of non-state actors such as al-Qaeda and its affiliates. For many thinkers, the acts of force which have come to characterise global conflict fall beyond the bounds of traditional just war thinking and outside conventional conceptions of war.</p>
                  
                  <p>To distinguish between acts of wholesale war, and acts of force which fall short of this benchmark, the philosopher Michael Walzer coined the term <em>jus ad vim</em>, which translates as &#8216;the just use of force&#8217;. For Walzer, common sense dictates that some military acts &#8211; like drone strikes &#8211; are so limited in their scope and consequence, that it would be unreasonable to categorize them as acts of war. Compared to acts of war, the drone attack has a predictable and circumscribed outcome, and therefore is appropriately judged by the requirements of <em>jus ad vim</em> rather than <em>jus in bello</em>. The destructive impact is evidently less, and the economic burden smaller than an outright act of war. Small-scale acts of political violence are something less than acts of war, and less objectionable for this reason.</p>
                  
                  <p>The moral distinctiveness of the drone assault turns on the probability of escalation. Assumed to be of such a small scale that it is unlikely to provoke full-scale war, the <em>jus ad vim</em> drone strike is claimed to be a proportionate response to violence or the threat of violence. In particular, the drone seems well placed to deal with the threat posed by non-state terrorists.</p>
                  
                  <p>For the proponent of the <em>jus ad vim</em> drone attack, terrorism has created a zone that is neither a zone of peace, nor a zone of war. Walzer argues that the war against terror is not addressed adequately by standard just war theory. (Walzer 2007, 480) Daniel Brunstetter and Megan Braun describe an &#8220;in-between space of moral uncertainty, where force is used on a consistent and limited scale, but war is not declared&#8221;. (Brunstetter and Braun 2013, 89) This is, however, a controversial view rejected by many analysts. Tony Coady, for example, offers an alternative position.</p>
                  
                  <p>Coady identifies as critical the threshold beyond which force is accepted. The use of force, he argues, should always be accompanied by &#8220;genuine reluctance&#8221; and come as an authentically <em>last</em> resort. Coady suggests the <em>jus ad vim</em> argument is too permissive, and argues &#8220;where it is really political violence rather than coercive diplomacy we are talking about, we do not need some more permissive theory distinct from just war thinking&#8221;. (Coady 2011, 93) This insight is significant, since drones exemplify military technology and the illusion which goes hand in hand with technological advance. The false impression is that military force can be absolutely restricted and in some way antiseptic, as the terminology reflects. Ordnance is &#8220;smart&#8221; and &#8220;highly localised&#8221;; targets are &#8220;serviced&#8221; in &#8220;surgical strikes&#8221; by &#8220;unmanned&#8221; and &#8220;precision&#8221; weapons. Emblematic of advanced military technology, the drone has provided part of an operational solution to the challenge of non-state terrorism. But the drone has also provoked philosophical problems both inside and beyond the declared war zone.</p>
                  
                  <p>When flown outside declared war zones by secretive bureaus such as the Central Intelligence Agency, the operation of covert lethal drones raises significant questions. The covert drone enables killing without justification, without judicial oversight and without the informed public debate critical to the collective democratic conscience.</p>
                  
                  <p>Philip Alston, United Nations Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, offers significant insight. In a study on targeted drone killings, submitted to the United Nations Human Rights Council on 28 May 2010, he criticised &#8220;the displacement of clear legal standards with a vaguely defined licence to kill, and the creation of a major accountability vacuum&#8221;. (Alston 2010, 3) Alston explained how the legitimate struggle against terrorism has been compromised by a proliferation of wicked acts, routinely explained away by the legal gloss of bureaucratic language, and he protested the failure of governments to &#8220;specify the legal justification for policies, to disclose the safeguards in place to ensure that targeted killings are in fact legal and accurate, or to provide accountability mechanisms for violations&#8221;. (Alston 2010, 3)</p>
                  
                  <p>Deep-rooted within the structures and procedures of government and invisible to public scrutiny, the covert drone program is a pragmatic response to the challenges of non-state terrorism. But, unquestioned and invisible the program is unsafely self-governing and unconstrained.</p>
                  
                  <p>Military personnel also fly military drones, in declared war zones and against recognised military objectives. In consequence, military drones do not seem a far cry from any weapons system where lethal force is applied with precision from extended range. But military drones are different, and distinction between them and less contentious stand-off systems provokes demanding <em>jus in bello</em> questions.</p>
                  
                  <p>A century after the industrial awfulness of the First War, the drone seems to be redefining combat as technological carnage. Separating soldiers from bloodshed, the drone epitomises killing in modern conflict. The drone embodies killing as an emphatically remote abstracted act. Separating soldiers physically from their homicide, the drone serves at the same time to exaggerate the moral distance between combatants. This is significant since, without obvious moral commitment, warfare lacks an imperative sense of sacrifice and chivalry. This is a dangerous turn of events because war is a moral endeavour. More than a physical fight, a base slaughter or a legal figment, war is a richly moral concept.</p>
                  
                  <p>When high ideals are sacrificed to pragmatism, the war is lost. This truism is made explicit in United States counterinsurgency doctrine (FM 3-24 / MCWP 3-33.5), where, in chapter seven, moral legitimacy is defined as critical to military accomplishment. Waged in the cause of a better peace, war demands ethical sensitivity. Without regard for moral ideals, the drone-wielding realists risk resentment, revenge and a cycle of endless conflict.</p>
                  
                  <p>The drone is a technological advance, which represents a profound and pervasive challenge. The drone is a relatively precise weapon, and one that limits the necessity for military &#8220;boots on the ground&#8221;. But the drone is not the means by which peace will be won, nor the means by which justice will be advanced. Our moral thinking must keep up. Drones must be understood and their application mastered, lest they become the concealed weapons of injustice.</p>

                  <p><strong><a href=""https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-clinton-fernandes"">Clinton Fernandes</a></strong></p>
                  
                  <p>Autonomous weapons systems are unmanned, but they are not identical to unmanned, remotely controlled systems. Instead, they function independently of human control once deployed, and can acquire, track, select and attack targets without requiring humans to make the critical decisions.</p>
                  
                  <p>Such a category of weapons often conjures up futuristic images of robots running amok and turning on their human masters, and sometimes of bonds of loyalty or jealousy between humans and robots. One need look no further than the 1920 play by Karel Capek (1890 &#8211; 1938) titled R.U.R. <em>(Rossum&#8217;s Universal Robots)</em> (Capek 2004), in which a scientist named Rossum creates humanlike machines known as robots (from the Czech word for forced labour). The robots later dominate humankind.</p>
                  
                  <p>Uneasiness about robots overthrowing human control was captured in Isaac Asimov&#8217;s classic science-fiction story &#8216;Runaround&#8217; (Asimov 1942), which contains the famous Three Laws of Robotics: a robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm; a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law; a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.</p>
                  
                  <p>Yet antipersonnel landmines and automated sentry guns &#8211; while clearly not humanlike machines &#8211; also qualify as autonomous weapons systems because, once deployed, they too acquire, track, select and attack targets independently of human intervention. At the other end of the current spectrum of technical sophistication, an anti-aircraft missile pursues its objective by performing rapid, complex calculations about range, velocity and trajectory.</p>
                  
                  <p>Autonomous weapons systems pose fundamental legal, ethical and political questions for modern militaries. Military interest in such weapon systems is said to derive from three factors. First, they may reduce future operating costs, particularly those related to recruiting, training, paying and caring for military personnel. Second, they may lower the risk of both friendly casualties and non-combatant &#8216;collateral damage&#8217; in comparison to their manned counterparts. Third, they may provide much greater military capability if a single weapons platform is able to acquire, track, select and attack targets and can do so at a speed that humans are simply unable to match.</p>
                  
                  <p>These potential advantages are very attractive to military forces. The US Navy, for example, is working on an unmanned surface-based vehicle that can detect, identify and neutralize a mine in a single sortie. Such a naval drone would combine the whole kill chain into one integrated, autonomous system. A key challenge, if unmanned underwater vehicles are to be deployed and left in position for weeks or months at a time, is fuel. One solution, still on the horizon, may be to turn ocean sediment into fuel. Research has already begun into microbial fuel cells that generate electricity using oxygen and organic material from the ocean.</p>
                  
                  <p>Formidable as these technical challenges may be, there are also daunting ethical challenges, the principal of which is how to make such weapons systems comply with the <em>jus in bello</em> principles of armed conflict discussed elsewhere in this course. It is no easy task to make autonomous weapons distinguish between combatants and civilians, and between combatants who are still active and those who have laid down their weapons or have been captured. Yet that distinction is demanded of human combatants under article 4 of the 1949 <em>Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War</em>: Persons are &#8216;protected&#8217; if they &#8216;at a given moment and in any manner whatsoever, find themselves, in case of a conflict or occupation, in the hands of a Party to the conflict or Occupying Power of which they are not nationals&#8217;. To obey this constraint, autonomous weapon systems will need to be able to distinguish between active enemy combatants and those who have laid down their weapons or have been captured. Autonomous weapon systems will also have to distinguish between civilians who are taking a direct part in hostilities and civilians who are not but are nevertheless carrying weapons (for example, law enforcement personnel or hunters).</p>
                  
                  <p>Autonomous weapon systems of this kind do not currently exist. It is sometimes said that such weapons will never exist, and that there will always be a need for a person &#8216;in the loop&#8217; (i.e. a human making the final targeting decisions) because even the best Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology will never be able to understand context. Machines are &#8220;very good at quantitative analysis, repetitive actions and sorting data, whereas humans outperform machines in qualitative judgement and reasoning&#8221;. (ICRC 2014, 1) Indeed, the ability of humans to disobey their orders is said to be an advantage, not a disadvantage. An oft-cited example is the 1983 case of Stanislav Petrov, a Soviet air defence officer who refused to believe credible reports from satellites in the Soviet space-based infra-red system that the United States had launched one and then several inter-continental ballistic missiles. A robot would not have been able to use such fine, nuanced judgements or to disobey its programming. Petrov is said to have averted nuclear war &#8211; something that a robot could not have done. As a &#8216;person in the loop&#8217;, Petrov realised that the launch of a few nuclear-tipped missiles did not make sense, regardless of what the data from the automated satellites was indicating. (Aksenov 2013)</p>
                  
                  <p>An ethical argument sometimes made for the use of (technologically-advanced) autonomous weapons is that they would have the ability (shared with remotely controlled weapons systems) to engage in extensive pre-attack surveillance by staying aloft for extended periods and enabling an attack during a brief window of opportunity. Unlike a human soldier, they would not be very concerned with taking cover and avoiding danger, and would therefore be more likely to identify the correct target than a human. The pressure of surviving combat is felt intensely by humans, who make quick decisions and often live to regret them. Autonomous weapons systems would also not be affected by emotions such as fear, revenge or anger, whereas a human soldier&#8217;s emotions may lead to the commission of war crimes. Thus, some have argued, an autonomous weapon would be more likely to avoid unnecessary loss of life. However, an autonomous weapon would not have compassion, either. Nor, as already mentioned, is it clear if such a system would ever be able to assess a genuine attempt to surrender.</p>
                  
                  <p>The possession of autonomous weapons that have greater precision than humans would make the use of such weapons more likely. And since the use of these weapons (as with remotely controlled weapons systems) occurs far from the public eye, there may not be much public opposition to their use. The potential consequence is that the death toll may mount slowly but steadily, and the domestic population does not experience the very real anger abroad.</p>
                  
                  <p>Further ethical challenges are posed by the issue of accountability: since a robot can&#8217;t be held accountable for a violation of international humanitarian law, who would? The programmer, the manufacturer or the commander who deploys the weapon in the field? As a result, there is an &#8216;accountability gap&#8217; that requires ethical, legal and political attention. Even if international law and ethics comes down on the side of retaining human control, there is no agreement over what would constitute &#8216;meaningful human control&#8217;. It may therefore be necessary to develop a new legal and ethical norm on &#8216;meaningful human control&#8217;.</p>
                  
                  <p>There is no doubt that the field of autonomous weapons systems will see extensive debate in the coming years.</p>

                  <p><strong><a href=""https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/associate-professor-stephen-m-coleman"">Dr. Stephen Coleman</a>, Ethics, UNSW Canberra<strong/></strong></p>
                  
                  <p>The development and use of new technologies may raise a number of ethical issues, and this is particularly obvious when new military technologies are being discussed. The ethical issues of new technologies are not captured by simply examining the law regarding the use of such technologies, for two main reasons. One reason is that while there is an intimate relationship between the disciplines of law and ethics, the questions raised by these two disciplines are not the same; whatever the future may hold it is impossible to get a sense of what the laws governing the use of a new technology ought to be without considering the ethical issues which that new technology raises.</p>
                  
                  <p>The second reason is that the law almost inevitably lags behind the development of new technologies, so it is usually only after a new technology has actually been developed that law makers start to consider how that technology ought to be regulated in law. The case of non-lethal weapons (NLW) is an interesting one, however, since existing international laws cover the use of some specific types of NLW while not addressing at all the use of other types of NLW other than in general provisions which apply to all weaponry used in armed conflicts. There are many reasons why it might be attractive to equip military personnel with non-lethal weapons, particularly when those military personnel are engaged in what are sometimes called &#8216;operations other than war&#8217;, a category which includes such things as peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions, armed humanitarian interventions, and even counter-insurgency operations. However, while there are attractions in the idea of issuing NLW to military personnel, there are also a range of problematic issues about such a move which ought to be highlighted.</p>
                  
                  <p>When discussing military use of NLW, it is the principles of <em>jus in bello</em> which are of interest, i.e. the principles of discrimination and proportionality. These principles have been incorporated into the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) in a number of ways, in that there are general principles in LOAC which ban indiscriminate and/or disproportionate attacks no matter what weapon is used, as well as treaties which ban the use of certain types of weaponry because these weapons are considered either to be indiscriminate or to cause disproportional harm, or both. Some NLW are discussed in LOAC, others are not. For example, non-lethal Riot Control Agents (RCA) are discussed in LOAC, having been banned as a weapon of war by the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993. It is obviously possible that these weapons could be used in a discriminate and proportionate manner which would in fact reduce the harms of war, and then U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld actually commented on this situation, complaining in testimony to the House Armed Services Committee that &#8220;in many instances our forces are allowed to shoot somebody and kill them, but they&#8217;re not allowed to use a non-lethal riot control agent.&#8221; (Knickerbocker 2003) The reason that the Chemical Weapons Convention actually bans the use of RCAs as a weapon of war is almost certainly due to the concern that RCAs may be used as lethal force multipliers rather than lethal force avoiders, in that they may be used in combination with the use of lethal force thus increasing, rather than decreasing, the lethality of the military operations in which such weapons are used.</p>
                  
                  <p>Some types of weapons are banned for what might perhaps be thought of, for want of a better term, as &#8216;cultural/socio-economic&#8217; reasons, in that the ban on such weapons seems to make little sense in some places or cultures but can be much more easily understood when examined from a different perspective. The ban on permanently blinding laser weapons might fit into this category; this is an interesting case since such weapons might easily be defined by some people as non-lethal &#8211; while they clear cause permanent harm they do not directly kill their target. A soldier from the USA, for example, may find it difficult to understand why it isn&#8217;t seen to be disproportionate to shoot an enemy and kill them, but is seen to be disproportionate to permanently blind that same person. But in many less developed parts of the world, a blind person who does not have family who are willing and able to care for them will almost certainly be reduced to begging on the street in order to survive. Given such a future, it can certainly be argued that the difference between being shot with a bullet and being blinded by a laser is that the bullet will kill its target quickly and relatively painlessly, while the blinding laser will condemn its target to a long slow death of suffering and starvation. When seen in these terms, the claim that permanently blinding laser weapons inflict disproportionate harm makes considerably more sense.</p>
                  
                  <p>When the principle of discrimination is applied to the use of lethal force, it is always applied <em>before</em> the use of that force; military personnel are simply not permitted to deliberately target non-combatants. However, many advocates of NLW seem to advocate their use in a manner which applies the principle of discrimination <em>after</em> the use of force rather than before, essentially suggesting that NLW be used against everyone located in a conflict zone, combatants and non-combatants alike, then assessing after the fact who is and is not a combatant and taking additional action against the combatants while releasing the non-combatants. Such actions certainly seem problematic in terms of <em>jus in bello</em>. While the military are not routinely equipped with NLW, other armed forces, such as police officers, often are equipped with NLW, and the range of problems caused by the discriminate use of such weapons by those equipped with them certainly suggests that we ought to be very cautious indeed about proposing the indiscriminate use of such weapons.</p>
                  
                  <p>One final point which ought to be made is perhaps an obvious one, but is nonetheless extremely important. Many companies are engaged in various forms of research into NLW around the world and the holy grail of such research is to develop the perfect NLW; one whose effects are temporary and reversible without any medical intervention, but are unpleasant enough to ensure compliance with the directions of the user. Groups such as Amnesty International already worry about the potential for existing NLW to be used for purposes such as torture (Amnesty Internatonal 2011) so it should never be forgotten that the perfect NLW is also likely to be perfect for abuse; enabling painful punishment to be inflicted on the victim by an unscrupulous user with minimal risk of detection. Given the stressful situations which military personnel are often placed in, the risk to life and limb that they may face, and the tendency of such personnel to de-humanise their enemies, it seems a near certainty that some types of NLW would be misused by military personnel if they were to be issued with them. This is one final reason to be wary about the use of NLW by military personnel.</p>

                  <p><strong><a href=""http://adfa.academia.edu/MarinaMiron"">Marina Miron</a>, PhD Candidate, UNSW Canberra<strong/></strong></p>
                  
                  <p>The idea of warfare in the cyber domain, or cyberspace, was born with the emergence of the World Wide Web (or the modern Internet) in 1993. Since then the world has witnessed a number of cyber offensives, including the attacks initiated against Estonian websites in 2007 resulting from political tensions between Russia and Estonia; those that took place during the war between Russia and Georgia in August 2008; and the Stuxnet worm that infiltrated Iranian uranium-enrichment facilities in 2010.</p>
                  
                  <p>Cyber-warfare specialist Martin Libicki defines cyberspace as &#8220;an agglomeration of individual computing devices that are networked to one another (e.g., an office local-area network or a corporate wide-area network) and to the outside world&#8221; (Libicki 2009, 6). Nowadays, all developed states exploit the virtual space in all conceivable areas, i.e., finance, electricity, water, transportation, military matters, etc. Consequently, cyberspace constitutes an important pillar of a state&#8217;s infrastructure. A military&#8217;s command and control networks, for instance, are highly dependent on cyberspace where its uses range from intelligence gathering to operating drones in a battle theatre. The use of cyberspace is, of course, not limited to states. Non-state actors such as insurgent groups have also shown a high degree of reliance upon cyberspace, employing it for various activities including the recruitment of new members, communication and counterintelligence, to name but a few. In general, reliance upon cyberspace continues to grow exponentially.</p>
                  
                  <p>Cyberspace&#8217;s unlimited and unregulated nature makes cyberoperations an attractive instrument of aggression. Some of the great advantages of launching a cyberattack include its cost-effectiveness and its ability to close the capabilities gap between stronger and weaker states. On the other hand, preventing such an attack (developing and reinforcing cyber-defense infrastructures) is complicated and expensive. Cyberattacks can be launched from almost any geographical location, and require significantly less time and resources than a conventional attack. Thus, cyberspace enables an attacker to overcome the spatial and temporal dimensions, and, most importantly, to remain virtually anonymous at low cost. Possibly the most significant merit of cyberattacks is their digital nature, which neither requires the deployment of a state&#8217;s military, nor directly leads to any casualties. Force projection is thus facilitated, significantly reducing political pressure upon state&#8217;s leaders, unlike in conventional cases that often require large-scale commitments.</p>
                  
                  <p>In addressing the ethics of cyberwarfare I will limit the scope of my comments to the ethics of attacks carried out against a state&#8217;s structures and not constituting an auxiliary part of broader military operations (Libicki 2009, 7). From the perspective of the laws of armed conflict, only states have the legitimate authority to resort to force. Though there are arguments in favour of legitimate non-state use of force, the brief nature of this chapter means I cannot consider this issue here. Finally, to borrow from Clausewitz&#8217;s concept of war, cyberwar shall be defined as an extension of political aims by means of conducting attacks in cyberspace that would constitute a threat to national security (Shakarian, et. al. 2013, 2).</p>
                  
                  <p>So, can cyberwarfare be ethical? To answer this question, to answer this question three important aspects need to be considered: just cause, proportionality and discrimination.</p>
                  
                  <p>The first and the most crucial criterion related to the use of force by a state is a just cause, a pillar of the <em>jus ad bellum</em> requirements of Just War Theory (JWT). The modern interpretation of JWT embodied in the UN Charter prohibits the use of force (or threat thereof) unless it is used in self-defense. This leads to several questions when applied to cyberwarfare. A critical question for state being attacked is, who should be regarded as the perpetrator, i.e., is the source an opposing state&#8217;s military or civilian elements, or even non-state actors? And can a cyberattack be regarded as a use of force? Is it then ethical to use kinetic force in retribution, or is it more appropriate to launch a counter-cyberattack?</p>
                  
                  <p>These questions have led to states&#8217; reluctance to respond to cyberattacks due to their fear of violating the laws of war, thus leaving the attacker with effective impunity (Carr 2012, 45-46). Since such laws require states to attribute an attack to a particular foreign government, determining the perpetrator behind the attacks can become a costly and time-consuming task, and one rarely possible to accomplish. This is precisely why most defences against cyberattacks are passive in their nature, generally focused on decreasing network vulnerabilities.</p>
                  
                  <p>In cases of conventional attack one can usually pinpoint the source of attack. If a missile is launched from a location in state A to strike a counterforce target in a location in state B, one can generally presume that state A used kinetic force against state B. Customary law has been violated, and state B then has the right to retaliate. In cyberspace, however, it is difficult to trace the aggressor and to determine their nature. If a worm or a piece of malware infects computers in various countries, it becomes extremely complicated to determine the responsible and their location. If the attacker is a civilian, then the &#8216;attack&#8217; should be classified a cybercrime making the international law of armed conflict inapplicable (Singer and Friedman 2014, 73-76). In such cases, the reliance falls upon the domestic criminal law of the source country. If the attacker, however, is an agent of the state, then the victim-state might respond by invoking its right to self-defence. But what kind of response is then appropriate?</p>
                  
                  <p>In order to adhere to <em>jus in bello</em> ethical principles during the conduct of war a state needs to ensure that its response is proportional. In other words, the defensive action to be implemented should not create more damage (if any) than necessary. Further, the attack should be discriminate, directed only against legitimate targets. These should exclude non-state civilian objects. The problem in this case, unlike in conventional warfare, is that it is impossible to predict the consequences of a cyberattack, beyond the intended ones. The example of the Stuxnet worm is a good illustration. This cyberattack was successful in crippling its target, and Iranian uranium enrichment facility. However, the Stuxnet worm also went on to infect hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide. This is clearly problematic. However it must be kept in mind that no civilians were physically harmed by Stuxnet, and as such the attack can be considered as proportional in contrast to the attacks carried out by Israel against an Iraqi nuclear research facility in 1981. This led to the deaths of eleven civilians and soldiers (Singer and Friedman 2014, 118-119).</p>
                  
                  <p>There is, nonetheless, no plausible justification for excluding the possibility that a defensive cyberattack might produce either intended or unintended kinetic effects spilling over into the real world. For example, a worm might infect an air-traffic control system leading to an aircraft crash in which civilians would die. In such a case, the use of defensive cyberwarfare would result in both the principles of proportionality and discrimination being violated.</p>
                  
                  <p>While cyberwarfare might appear as more ethical than a conventional attack due to the possibility of avoiding open conflict, the discussion above demonstrates complexities involved. While the world has not yet seen any horrifying cyberattacks, we should not underestimate the potential of this kind of warfare to cause a great amount of damage. Unfortunately, the present legal framework falls short of addressing the use of so-called cyberweapons. Many of the classical ethical norms are also challenging to apply in the case of cyberwarfare. While adjustments need to take place, cyberwarfare should remain subject to those norms already present in regard to the conduct of warfare.</p>
