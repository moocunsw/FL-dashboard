                  <p>60 years of classic textbooks defined the traditional Engineering Mechanics course. They decided what should be in them and how to teach it. They still do.</p>
                  
                  <p>Online courses like this offer new ways of presenting Engineering Mechanics, and we&#8217;ve freed ourselves from the traditional course structure. So as well as Engineering Mechanics we have guest appearances from material science, mechanics of solids, and fluid mechanics - whatever is needed for supporting design activities, and for developing Engineers&#8217; Eyes.
                  Engineering Mechanics is based on mathematics. It&#8217;s an essential part of its magic. But we&#8217;ll keep the mathematics simple. You&#8217;ll need basic algebra and trigonometry. There is no calculus.</p>
                  
                  <p>We&#8217;ll live in the moment. But you can also use this course to prepare for future formal courses, or review what you have learnt in the past.</p>
                  
                  <p>The full suite of activities would take up to four hours a week, for seven weeks. But you can pick and choose which parts you would like to do.</p>

                  <p>There&#8217;s no better way to consolidate learning in Engineering Mechanics than quietly working through problems using pencil and paper (that&#8217;s why we call this a &#8216;Retro Tutorial&#8217;). It can be satisfying too.</p>
                  
                  <p>&#8216;Retro&#8217; means a modern version of an older style, like a modern car based on a classic from a past era. Tutorial means questions for you to practise your new skills on. You will do them on paper with a pencil and a scientific calculator.</p>
                  
                  <p>This tutorial is mainly about springs. If you do all the questions it might take <strong>45 minutes</strong>.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Download the tutorial in the Downloads section below and work through the questions.</strong>
                  It includes solutions. It&#8217;s probably best if you try the problem first before looking at the solution. We find that those who look at the solution and decide &#8220;I could have done that&#8221; are often kidding themselves.</p>

                  <h3 id=""force"">Force</h3>
                  <p>A mysterious interaction between objects. It is a vector quantity. Accelerations are caused by forces, as are deflections in elastic members. The SI unit of force is the Newton, derived from mass, distance and time. It is the force that would give a mass of 1 kg an acceleration of 1 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</p>

But we&#8217;ll stick with Newton&#8217;s understanding, which is fine for engineering tasks on Earth. We call the gravitational force on an object its weight and calculate it as the product of mass and the acceleration in free fall due to gravity, or W=mg. With mass in kg and acceleration in m/s<sup>2</sup>, the force is given in Newtons.</p>

                  <p>There&#8217;s no better way to consolidate learning in Engineering Mechanics than quietly working through problems using pencil and paper (that&#8217;s why we call this a &#8216;Retro Tutorial&#8217;).</p>
                  
                  <p>This is a fine example of why the retro-tutorials are included. Producing an FBD (Free Body Diagram) is a creative activity. You start with a &#8216;real-world&#8217; scenario and you need to end up with an abstraction of it to analyse.</p>
                  
                  <p>Drawing an FBD from scratch is so different from selecting a preferred solution from a gallery of options. This forward-looking format is much more like real life, so see what you can do without looking at the solution first.</p>
                  
                  <p>Depending upon your grasp of basic trigonometry you might want to do the revision questions on that topic. But whatever your degree of prior knowledge it would be good to do at least some of the problems on components and resultants.</p>
                  
                  <p>This tutorial is in two parts: 1  Free-Body Diagrams and 2  basic trigonometry, with a bonus question at the end.</p>
                  
                  <p>The FBD questions are highly recommended. Expect to spend up to <strong>20 minutes</strong>.</p>
                  
                  <p>The questions on trigonometry will be revision for some, and, perhaps, less familiar to others. If you are confident in your trigonometry just review them. Otherwise go though them in detail and check out the solutions.  The time to do these will depend on what you already know.</p>
                  
                  <p>The bonus question is quick and (I think) fun.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Download the tutorial in the Downloads section below and work through the questions.</strong> It includes solutions. It&#8217;s probably best if you try the problem first before looking at the solution.</p>

                  <p>As ever, there&#8217;s no better way to consolidate learning in Engineering Mechanics than quietly working through problems using pencil and paper (that&#8217;s why we call this a &#8216;Retro Tutorial&#8217;).</p>
                  
                  <p>This week&#8217;s topics are: Free-Body Diagrams, calculating moments, and equilibrium of rigid bodies (with an extension to shear strength of bolts).</p>
                  
                  <p>Expect to spend <strong>20 minutes</strong> on these. It pays to be pedantic about drawing FBDs. Taking liberties with even the simplest problem can lead to strife.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Download the tutorial in the Downloads section below and work through the questions.</strong> It includes solutions. It&#8217;s probably best if you try the problem first before looking at the solution.</p>

                  <p>This is an optional Adaptive Tutorial for you. An Adaptive Tutorial adapts to the choices you make within its rich and interactive activities. Your experience will be tailored depending on the things you do.</p>
                  
                  <p>In this tutorial you will learn to construct Free-Body Diagrams (FBDs) from objects that are shown as pictures.</p>
                  
                  <p>You will specify forces or moments at the points of force application located on the body and define the system isolation.</p>
                  
                  <p>This tutorial should take 20-25 minutes to complete.</p>

                  <p>There&#8217;s no better way to consolidate learning in Engineering Mechanics than quietly working through problems using pencil and paper (that&#8217;s why we call this a &#8216;Retro Tutorial&#8217;).</p>
                  
                  <p>The equations and data in this week&#8217;s retro tutorial are taken from actual engineering practice. It will be a fine contribution towards developing engineers&#8217; eyes.</p>
                  
                  <p>You will cover rolling resistance for trains, analyse aerodynamic forces on the glider of week 4, and the range of the miniature vehicle we analysed this week.</p>
                  
                  <p>If you do them all and get hooked it might take <strong>an hour</strong>, but it will be worth it for the sheer existential pleasure of it all.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Download the tutorial in the Downloads section below and work through the questions.</strong> It includes solutions. It&#8217;s probably best if you try the problem first before looking at the solution.</p>

                  <p>Dear Participants,<br/>
                  It is my great pleasure in thanking you all for participating in the second iteration of this course and providing us with enough encouragement, constructive comments and motivation to continue offering this course again. Your comments and suggestions are very valuable to us and we will look into each one of them very carefully!</p>
                  
                  <p>Robin has been the backbone of this course and Jay&#8217;s contribution has been phenomenal. This course offering could not have been possible without the full support of my colleagues John Vulic and Moein Ghodrati who worked behind the scene uninterruptedly over the last several months. Thank you all!</p>
                  
                  <p>Best wishes<br/>
                  Gangadhara Prusty</p>
