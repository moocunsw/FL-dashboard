I note that the tutors claim that this course presents the subject matter in a new way.

This occurs in metals at room temperature also, due to the same process. (tho the amount of creep is much smaller)

I fear it doesn't actually answer the question being asked tho. lol
I may have over complicated the question by a factor of about 10x lol
Its actually asking about the series relationship and how the travel per kg remains the same for each spring in series, yet each spring in a series connection will see the same total weight applied to all the springs in a series connection.so you end up with longer total travel, yet the same amount of travel for each individual series connected spring.

Indeed, the reality of things always allows you to whether confirm what you already theorised of verify what you calculations tell you.. Fascinatings indeed.

Did you work out why a chain of bands produces a larger deflection than a single band?
What else did you notice in the video?

I assume,  and i say assume as this is the first thought that comes into my mind: It adds up. The mass and of course, component of one rubber won't deliver as much elasticity as a two would. Probably they don't add up as  2 rubbers = 2x1Rubber's slasticity, but an accurate enough approximation, i believe it must be close  to it.. 

What else did you notice in the video? 

On the graphic, the wide load range is not lineal, i think due to the neither lineal elasticity of the rubbers, as there are clips in between them perhaps, or something to do with the tolerance in the materials they are made of.

At the moment, I'm studying and working on obtaining my cert III in ECEC, and I've met up with my TAFE career counsellor last month and she asks me, 'Why do you want to be a Civil Engineer?', and I said, 'Well, I've always had this strong desire to build; to build houses, infrastructure. And she said, 'But, Civil Engineering is all about building roads and bridges, not houses'.
'No, a family friend of ours is a Civil Engineer, that's what he studied and I don't see him being restricted to building roads and bridges only'.And then, she asked, 'Do know what's involved in your course?'.

My guess is that more rubberbands result in greater deflection due to the distribution of the stress, which is more focused in this case.

Mass is the quantity of matter while weight is the force of gravity acting on the mass. In SI units, mass is in kg; force (including weight) is in Newtons. The weight of 1 kg (in Sydney) is 9.8 N. In imperial measure (US customary units) mass is in 'pounds mass'; force is in 'pounds force' - ie the gravity force acting upon a pound mass. Despite the similarity in words you can't assume that what they are describing is the same thing. In ordinary use we don't make this distinction; we want a given quantity of potatoes, which will be in kg, but to get the required amount we 'weigh' them on scales calibrated in kg (kilogram force perhaps).

This is the opposite of what we have been asked to do since we are not going to be subjected to calculus. However, from comments I have read, I think most students would be able to use the equation to get the exact value of the load and I'm sure that the rest of the students would be able to understand it.

The behavior of the spring is not constant. To get a deflection of 50 mm was pretty easy. You can see that for an extra 50 mm a much bigger extra load is needed. The question is how does the spring behave at hundred millimetre deflection? The tangential line investigates the behaviour from let's say 98 to 100 mm.

Definition: stiffness = (change in force)/(change in length)

To find this at any load point,  you can find the length at a load just below the load point, then at a load the same amount above the load point, then find the stiffness by:

stiffness = (change in force)/(change in length)

If the two loads are close enough, you.will get a good approximation to the tangent at that load point.

Now repeat it for a higher load point.

For a linear spring, these two stiffness values will be the same.

For a stiffening spring, the value at the higher load point will be higher

For a softening spring, the value at the higher load point will be lower.

I hope that helps, but in an case, if you haven't got it completely, why not leave it for a while and come back to it later if you want. It shouldn't affect your progress.

I didn't have enough space on the comment to also explain that instead of a linear equation the function f(l) would become a quadratic equation (a curvy one) which we were shown in the example.
That also is probably too much for me to go into and, although I love maths, I won't mention any maths again. I can play with it myself but I don't want to appear as an arrogant pain in the bum. 
There is still so much in this course which I don't have any idea of and I'm looking forward to learning certain aspects of Engineering. If I want to go into explanations mathematically I can do it on my own but I think that understanding what I would be dealing with would be so important if I wanted to take it further.
This seems similar to what Einstein said to a fellow Physicist. He said that you have to understand the Physics before you can apply the maths. So that is what I'm going to try with the Engineering information this course will give us.

I've taken a few Future Learn courses, and they do offer relatively light treatments of their subject matter. Great for some people, not great for others.

Since the bands all came from the same source I assume they were all of similar stiffness when new. The only difference between the bands is that last week's have 'worked' already and have been sitting in the daylight. I think I've found evidence that light and work may reduce the bands' stiffness.

The definition of transducer was from my head. Now that you have raised the issue I just checked out various sources. 
On the web I found:
+  a device that converts variations in a physical quantity, such as pressure or brightness, into an electrical signal, or vice versa.
+  a device that converts one form of energy to another
or, from my favourite dictionary (Australian Concise Oxford):
+  Any device for converting a signal from one medium of transmission to another, esp a non-electrical signal into an electrical one, eg pressure into voltage. As is often the case, the etymology (origin) is interesting: it's from the Latin transducere 'lead across'.
For any force transducer it's not obvious how a deflection or a voltage can be considered a form of energy, and I can't easily see how they are 'a medium of transmission'. I think my definition captures the essence of it - you want to know the force in an object; you can't measure it directly, so you  measure deflection and apply a calibration.

WHY is the force arrow LW shown within the balloon?
I'm happy that force shown L is within the balloon, but surely the force W should either begin at the centre of gravity of the balloon OR at the lowest point OUTSIDE the balloon.
WHY does the force arrow W2 begin outside the body of the basket component?
WHY is T used. (i.e. what does it stand for?)

If the pushchair was not braked, we were told it had a brake but was stationary due to the friction of the slope, then is it simply a matter of the downward force of gravity and the upward forces at the point of contact of the wheels and the ground balancing each other out, that keep the pushchair stationary?
IF we do need to show some force that resists backwards motion (that is NOT applied by the brake) why does it not act on BOTH the wheels of the pushchair? Might it be to do with the front wheels being forward of the centre of gravity?

the quiz seems to be about trying to catch people out rather than testing understanding. 
eg why ask ""which is the odd one out""? this is superfluous to the question - all you need to ask is ""which statement is least true"". it has nothing to do with being the odd one out anyway. all the quizzes are phrased this way and i can see no reason for it other than to try to confuse. 
Q3. apparently the correct answer is the joke at the bottom, ""a good joke is ..."". which is obviously a subjective statement. how can anyone possibly get this right? how are we supposed to know you dont think this is a good joke?  if you meant the statement in quotes, then it should not have been in quotes, and there should have been a single statement. in this answer option there are 2 statements, and its impossible to know which you intend.
sorry but i find these quizzes very unhelpful. they put the emphasis on untrue statements instead of reinforcing what we are supposed to have learnt. also proclaiming ""Correct"" when a possibly incorrect statement is chosen, and ""Incorrect"" for a correct one, is subliminally misleading.",2017-05-21 09:28:11 UTC,0,,,,

I looked at it rather differently. If it is on the point of tipping, A=0 and N=mg. If N=mg then -a/(Us*h-2a) must equal 1, dividing top and bottom by a I got -(Us*h/a-2) =1, and with h/A=.9/.3 this gives -Us*3+2=1 or Us=1/3. If Us is less than I it will slide if it is more it will tip; now 0.35 is bigger than 1/3 so it will tip. I hadn't looked at it like this before; thank you for raising the point.",2017-06-03 13:47:40 UTC,0,,,,
